<p class='c008'>“It seems queer not to have Harry along with
us on this trip to the war zone of Europe!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just what Pudge, here, was saying last night,
Billy. But you know my brother Harry has been
ordered by Doctor Perkins to keep quiet for two
whole months.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Frank, he was lucky to break only his arm and
collar bone, when it might have been his neck, in
that nasty fall. But why are you rubbing your eyes
like that, I’d like to know, Pudge Perkins?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pirates and parachutes, I’ll tell you why, Billy.
Every little while I get to thinking I must be dreaming.
So I pinch myself, and dig my knuckles in my
eyes to make sure. But it’s the real thing, isn’t it,
boys?”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_6' id='Page_6'>6</a></span>
“If you mean that the three of us, here, representing
the <em>Sea Eagle Company, Limited</em>, of Brig Island,
in Casco Bay, Maine, makers of up-to-date seaplanes,
have come over to look up a sample shipment of our
manufactures, and find ourselves being pestered by
the French and British Governments to take a contract
from them, why it certainly is the real thing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was lucky my father has that arrangement with
the French Government to protect our property
through thick and thin,” continued the boy called
Pudge, who, as his name would signify, was very
rotund in build, with a rosy face, and a good-natured
twinkle in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, only for that they would have commandeered
the boxed seaplane long ago, and by now dozens of
fleets made on the same model would be pouncing on
the German bases along the Belgian coast,” remarked
the boy whose name was Frank, and to whom the
other two evidently looked up as though he might be
their leader in the enterprise requiring skill and courage.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But they’ve been mighty good to us since then,”
went on Pudge. “They have allowed us to have a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_7' id='Page_7'>7</a></span>
substantial hangar built after our own peculiar pattern
within reach of the water here at Dunkirk, though
we are not so many miles away from where the Allies
are fighting the Kaiser’s men who are in Belgian
trenches.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” added Billy Barnes, who had once been a
lively reporter, now a member of the aëroplane manufacturing
company engaged in making the remarkable
type of airships invented by Pudge’s scientific
father, Doctor Perkins, “and during these weeks we’ve
been able to get our machine together, so that right
now it’s in prime condition for making a flight on the
sea or in the air.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whisper that next time, Billy,” cautioned Frank,
casting a quick glance about him as the three boys
continued to walk along the road leading out of Dunkirk,
which in places even skirted the water’s edge.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, what’s up, Frank?” exclaimed the talkative
Billy. “Do you think these bushes and trees have
ears?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, but there might be some sharp German spy
hanging around this place,” replied the other earnestly.
“You know they do say they’re everywhere. I’ve
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_8' id='Page_8'>8</a></span>
heard British soldiers in Calais and Dunkirk tell of
mysterious strangers who disappeared when approached
as if they were made of smoke. This spy
system the Kaiser’s men have down to a fine point.
It’s hard to keep anything from being carried to German
Headquarters these days.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Still, there are a lot of things they haven’t learned
before they happened,” declared Billy. “That first
British army of some eighty thousand soldiers came
over to France, and nobody knew a thing about it until
they were on the firing line. But, Frank, do you
reckon the Germans have been watching the three of
us working here with our hangar and hydro-aëroplane?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m as sure of it as I am of my own name,” declared
the other firmly. “Why, the very fact that our
hangar differed so much from ordinary ones, being
so much larger for one thing, would make them suspect.
Then there has been a heap of talk going on
about this wonderful airship of ours, which was carried,
every word of it, to German Headquarters.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Batter and butterflies!” spluttered Pudge, who
seemed addicted to strange exclamations, especially
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_9' id='Page_9'>9</a></span>
when excited, “we’ll certainly have to watch out, then,
now that our wonderful <em>Sea Eagle</em> is in working
order.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” said Billy Barnes earnestly, “it would be a
tough joke on the company to have some clever thieves
get away with it, just when we are ready to show
the French Government that it is away above ordinary
seaplanes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s the hangar, boys,” remarked Frank, with
a vein of relief in his voice, as though grave fears
may have been giving him more or less uneasiness.
“Stir your stumps, Pudge, and we’ll soon be under
our own roof. I may have a suggestion to make after
we’ve looked around a bit that I hope both of you
will agree with.”</p>

<p class='c009'>While the three chums are advancing on the
strangely elevated building that had been erected to
accommodate their seaplane, we may take advantage
of the opportunity to glance backward a bit, in order
to see who and what they were. We do this for the
benefit of those readers who may not have had the
good fortune to peruse previous volumes in this series.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_10' id='Page_10'>10</a></span>
Two bright, inventive brothers, New York boys,
who had actually built an aëroplane which they named
the <em>Golden Eagle</em>, had shipped it to Central America
when given a chance to save a plantation owned by
their father, and threatened by the revolutionists in
Nicaragua. This they had managed to accomplish,
through the assistance of a young reporter friend
named Billy Barnes. In this book, which was called
<em>The Boy Aviators in Nicaragua</em>, were also related the
thrilling adventures that befell the young air pilots
when their craft was carried out to sea in an electrical
storm; and also how they were rescued by
means of a wireless apparatus through which they
communicated with a steamer.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the second volume, <em>The Boy Aviators on Secret
Service</em>, the reader was taken to the mysterious
Everglades region of Florida where the young inventors
once more demonstrated their ability to grapple
with emergencies. They proved that they were
patriotic sons of Uncle Sam by discovering and putting
out of commission a factory that was making
dangerous explosives without the consent of the
Washington Government.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_11' id='Page_11'>11</a></span>
It was a long jump from Florida to the depths of
the Dark Continent, but the occasion arose necessitating
their taking this trip to Africa. If you want
to learn how theirs was virtually the first aëroplane
to soar above the trackless heart of Africa, how they
found the hidden hoard of priceless ivory secreted by
slavers in the wonderful Moon Mountains, what
strange things came about through their being hunted
by the vindictive Arab slave trader, with many other
interesting adventures, you can do so by procuring
<em>The Boy Aviators in Africa</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Through the coaxing of their warm chum, Billy
Barnes, the boys were next induced to enter in a competitive
race across the continent, and it can be easily
understood that the pages of this book, <em>The Boy
Aviators in Record Flight</em>, fairly teem with exciting
incidents and thrilling adventures. Crossing the great
Western cow country, they met with many difficulties
from sand storms to treacherous cowboys and renegade
Indians that threatened to end their game voyage.
But the same indomitable spirit that had carried
Frank and Harry through so many trials allowed
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_12' id='Page_12'>12</a></span>
them to meet with the glorious success they so richly
deserved.</p>

<p class='c009'>From one series of adventures like this it was easy
for the wide-awake young air pilots to engage in
others. A story of an old Spanish galleon caught in
the grip of that mysterious Sargasso Sea, where the
circling tides have held vessels amidst the floating
grass for centuries, fascinated them, and they set out
to explore the dismal region that has been the graveyard
for countless ships. Of course, the lure lay in
the fact that a vast treasure was said to be aboard
this old galleon; and the hunt for it, together with the
opposition caused by a rival expedition, makes great
reading for boys who have red blood in their veins.
It is all set down in <em>The Boy Aviators’ Treasure Quest</em>,
which has been voted one of the best of the entire
series.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>The Boy Aviators’ Polar Dash</em> was possibly the most
remarkable example of Young America’s nerve ever
written. How the brothers came to plan the trip to the
Antarctic region, and what amazing things happened
to them while carrying it out, you will certainly appreciate
when you read the book. The object of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_13' id='Page_13'>13</a></span>
the expedition was fairly covered, and they came back
in safety; but only for the aëroplane the result could
never have been attained, which proved how valuable
an airship might be amidst the eternal ice of the frozen
zones.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the volume following this, the boys again found
themselves caught in a swirl of exciting events. They
had become engaged to Doctor Perkins, who was not
only a scientific gentleman of note but particularly
an aviator bent on startling the world through the
agency of a monster seaplane which he had invented.
He believed that a voyage across the ocean could
easily be made in one of his safe aircraft, which combined
many features not as yet in common use among
the most advanced aviators. On Brig Island in Casco
Bay, within sight of the Maine coast, they erected
their factory, and manufactured various types of aëroplanes
for the market. So far this wonderful seaplane
had not been given to the world, for Doctor
Perkins was shrewd enough to first get his patents in
all foreign countries in order to protect his interests.
In <em>The Boy Aviators’ Flight for a Fortune</em> have been
related a series of remarkable adventures that befell
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_14' id='Page_14'>14</a></span>
the young air pilots when trying out the first of these
enormous hydro-aëroplanes, that would skim along
the water or sail through the air with equal swiftness
and safety.</p>

<p class='c009'>One of these enormous seaplanes had been boxed in
sections and shipped over to France, with the design
of giving the Government officials an actual exhibition
before they would agree to making a large contract
with the firm.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then the terrible world war had broken out, and for
some months it was not known just what had become
of the precious machine.</p>

<p class='c009'>Finally word was received that it was safe at
Havre, under the protection of the French Government,
which would adhere strictly to the letter of the
written agreement which they had entered into with
the American company.</p>

<p class='c009'>An urgent request was sent across the sea for some
competent aviators to come over and put the several
parts together, so that an actual test could be made.
The French Government, if the trial proved convincing,
stood ready to make almost any kind of contract
with the company. This would be either in the way
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_15' id='Page_15'>15</a></span>
of ordering a large number of seaplanes, providing
they could be delivered without breaking the neutrality
laws binding the United States, or else giving a
royalty on each and every machine manufactured in
France under the patents granted to the doctor.</p>

<p class='c009'>This necessary but brief explanation puts the
reader, who may not have previously known Frank
and his chums, in possession of facts concerning their
past. While Pudge Perkins, the doctor’s son, was
not an experienced aviator, he had picked up more
or less general knowledge in the factory, and had
come abroad with Frank and Billy, as he was accustomed
to say, just to “keep them from dying
of the blues, in case the French Government kept putting
them off from week to week, or if anything else
disagreeable happened.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Indeed, Pudge, with his abounding good nature, his
love for fun, and great capacity for eating, might be
looked upon as a pretty fine antidote for the dread
disease known as the “blues.” No one could long
remain depressed in mind when <em>he</em> was around. Besides,
Pudge was really smarter than he looked; appearances
in his case were apt to be deceptive; for
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_16' id='Page_16'>16</a></span>
the boy had a fund of native sagacity back of his
jolly ways.</p>

<p class='c009'>Their hangar had been built in a rather lonely spot
close to the water. This was done for several purposes,
chief among which might be mentioned their
desire to avoid publicity.</p>

<p class='c009'>The obliging French authorities had even placed
a guard at the point where the road passed the open
spot now enclosed with a high fence; and so effectual
had this proved that up to now the Americans had
really not been annoyed to any extent.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank, however, had known for some time that
all their movements were being watched from different
elevated stations in the way of hilltops, or the
roofs of houses, by men who carried field glasses. He
had many times caught the glint of the sun on the
lens when a movement was made.</p>

<p class='c009'>As long as it went no further than that Frank had
not cared, because these suspected spies could see
next to nothing. But of late serious fears had begun
to annoy him. The seaplane was ready for its first
trip, and in a condition where it might be stolen, if
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_17' id='Page_17'>17</a></span>
a band of daring men took it into their heads to make
the attempt.</p>

<p class='c009'>At one end of the hangar a long track with a gradual
slope ran down to the water, so that the seaplane
could be launched in that way if desired. A narrow
stairway on the land side led up to the stout door
which they always kept fastened with an odd padlock
capable of resisting considerable pressure.</p>

<p class='c009'>Each one of the three boys had a key for this lock,
which they were very careful to keep fastened to a
steel pocket chain. Pudge, having mounted the stair
first, puffing from the exertion, was about to insert
his key in the padlock when he was heard to utter
an exclamation. The others saw him look closely,
and then turn upon them with an expression of mingled
alarm and consternation on his round face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“As sure as you live, boys,” the stout boy gasped,
“that’s a bit of wax sticking to our padlock! Someone’s
been taking an impression so as to have a duplicate
key made!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 id='chII' class='c010'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <br />THE WORK OF GERMAN SPIES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>When that astonishing declaration made by Pudge
told the other two boys the nature of his discovery,
they also glanced at the suspicious atom of wax sticking
to the brass padlock.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sure enough, Frank; that it is,” gurgled Billy
Barnes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s no question about it,” admitted Frank, as
he took the fragment between his thumb and forefinger,
and examined it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It wasn’t here when we came around this morning,
I’d take my affidavy to that,” declared Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dories and dingbats, not a bit of it!” exclaimed
Pudge. “That padlock was as clean as a whistle, for
I rubbed it with my sleeve to brighten it. There’s
been some one snooping around here since then; and
I guess they must mean to come back again to-night
to steal the seaplane!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Open up, and let’s make sure things are all right
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_19' id='Page_19'>19</a></span>
still,” demanded Frank. “We can settle on some
sort of plan to upset their scheme by putting on a
new lock, or something like that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Pudge, with a trembling hand, managed to insert
his key, and upon the door being opened the three
boys hurried inside the curious elevated hangar. It
had been built with a metal roof, though whether
this would really prove bombproof in case of a German
air raid, such as had occurred several times, was
a question.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank goodness! everything seems to be O. K.,
boys!” cried Billy, after he had taken a swift survey
of the interior, including the monster seaplane built
on so advanced a model that there was certainly
nothing like it known to aviators.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank, too, breathed more freely, for he had not
known what to expect.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” he went on to say earnestly, “and we ought
to be mighty thankful that we’ve managed to get
along up to now without having our whole outfit
wrecked by a bomb, set on fire by a German spy,
or raided some night by a party of unknown persons
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_20' id='Page_20'>20</a></span>
who would have an interest in keeping the French
Government from getting this sample seaplane.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My idea is this,” remarked Billy soberly. “They
could have done the mischief at almost any time, but
some one in authority thought it would be a brighter
idea for them to wait until we had finished working
on the plane, and then steal it, so that the Germans
could copy our model for their army.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gatling guns and grasshoppers, but I think you
must be right, Billy,” exploded Pudge. “Haven’t we
known that they kept a steady watch on us while we
worked away here, even if they couldn’t see much?
And many a time we disputed whether those chaps
were German spies, or Frenchmen set on guard so
as to make sure we didn’t take a notion to fly away
some day to the enemy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank was looking unusually serious, and it could
be plainly seen that he had a weight on his mind.
The afternoon was near its close; and before long
the shadows of a dark February night would be closing
in around them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“One thing sure, boys,” he finally said, “we must
not leave our seaplane unguarded another night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_21' id='Page_21'>21</a></span>
“Do you think they mean to make away with it tonight,
Frank?” demanded Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In some way they seem to know we’ve finished our
work,” came the reply. “It puzzles me to guess how
they learned it, when we only this noon notified the
French authorities in secret that we were ready for
any sort of long-distance test they might wish to
order.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Must be a leak at Headquarters!” suggested Billy
quickly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tamales and terrapins, that would be a nice proposition,
I should think!” ejaculated Pudge.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s step out and look around a little,” suggested
Frank. “Perhaps we may find some trace of these
unwelcome visitors who have managed to get up here
to our door in spite of the soldier standing guard
by the gate of our stockade.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They must have come from the water side, Frank,”
Pudge was heard to say as he followed the others
down the stairway that led to the ground.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Be careful how you step around,” cautioned
Frank. “Here, both of you plant a foot alongside
mine, and in that way we’ll have a set of prints to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_22' id='Page_22'>22</a></span>
go by. Now notice just what they look like, and
see if you can find any fresh marks that are different
in some way from ours.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was an easy task he had set them, for almost
immediately Billy sang out to the effect that he had
made a discovery, and hardly had he ceased speaking
when Pudge announced that he, too, wanted Frank’s
opinion on a footprint that was much too large to
have been made by any of them.</p>

<p class='c009'>A further hunt revealed the fact that apparently
three parties must have been at the foot of the steps
leading up to their locked hangar. This important
discovery was anything but pleasant to Frank Chester;
it told him that a crisis was undoubtedly approaching
their enterprise, which would seriously affect
its success or failure.</p>

<p class='c009'>What if, after all their earnest work, just when
the wonderful seaplane had been made ready for a
flight, those secret emissaries of the Germans managed
to steal it away! Doubtless they had prepared
for just such a stroke, and had an experienced air
pilot hovering around so as to take charge of the
hydro-aëroplane after it was successfully launched.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_23' id='Page_23'>23</a></span>
That would be the last the aëroplane boys would
ever see of their valuable property. In time of war
all devices are recognized as proper, and this theft
of the American seaplane would be hailed as one of
the most glorious feats of the German arms, as well
as a serious blow at the air power of the Allies.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s only one thing to be done,” said Frank,
turning to the stout chum, “if you are game to tackle
it, Pudge.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The fat boy winced but set his teeth hard together.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Rifles and rattlesnakes, just try me, Frank, that’s
all!” he chortled, squaring his shoulders aggressively
in a manner the others both knew meant that his
fighting blood had been aroused.</p>

<p class='c009'>“While Billy and I stay here to guard the machine,
you must go back to town and get another kind of
padlock, Pudge!” exclaimed Frank. “Pick out one
that will hold as securely as this does. If we have
to change it every day, we’ve got to make a sure thing
of it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Was it that you said you meant to speak about
after we got inside the hangar, Frank?” inquired
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_24' id='Page_24'>24</a></span>
Billy as Pudge prepared to start bravely away through
the gathering shadows of evening.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, it was something along the same lines,” explained
Frank; “in fact, I meant to suggest that one
of us stay here nights until we had word from Headquarters
that the hour had come to make our test,
and prove that the <em>Sea Eagle</em> could stand up against
a gale when common seaplanes would go to smash,
or have to stay at their moorings.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mumps and mathematics, but I agree with you
there, Frank!” cried Pudge. “And for one I’m in
favor of camping out here right along. We could rig
up a little stove, and cook our meals. It would be
good fun at that, because then we’d have the real old-fashioned
Yankee grub instead of this French fool
stuff that never satisfies a healthy appetite.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The others looked at Pudge and exchanged nods.
They knew his failing, and could sympathize with the
poor fellow. Pudge was patriotic enough to prefer
the American style of cooking, which always spelled
abundance according to his way of thinking.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m off, fellows,” he now announced. “Look for
me inside of an hour or so. Of course, it’ll be about
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_25' id='Page_25'>25</a></span>
dark by then, but I know every stone on the road between
here and town, I’ve traveled along the way
so often. So long!”</p>

<p class='c009'>With a genial wave of his hand, Pudge left them.
The other pair looked after him with considerable
solicitude; there was only one Pudge after all, according
to their opinion, and he had a happy faculty
for wrapping himself in the affections of his mates.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You don’t think anything could happen to him
going or coming, do you, Frank?” asked Billy Barnes,
as they saw Pudge vanish through the partly open
gate of the high stockade.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, no; I hardly think so,” replied the other
slowly. “Perhaps I should have gone for the padlock
myself. If I had thought twice, I would have done
that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Too late—Pudge is on the way,” remarked Billy.
“Let’s go up and take a peep around once more to
see that everything is in apple-pie shape—each wire-stay
keyed up to the right tune for efficiency, the motors
ready to do business, the gas pump lubricated,
and, in fact, our machine fit to toe the scratch as if
there were a race on.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_26' id='Page_26'>26</a></span>
Once they were inside the hangar, Frank fastened
the door with a bar that had been arranged for just
such a purpose. Then, turning on a flood of light
from an acetylene gas battery, they examined every
part of the big seaplane. It had something of the
appearance of a gigantic sleeping bat as it lay there
motionless, but with all the attributes of tremendous
power for skimming along on the surface of the
water or soaring among the clouds.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In perfect condition, as far as I can make out!”
remarked Frank, after they had completed this careful
survey.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” added the other, with a glow of excusable
enthusiasm on his face, “and if there was any necessity
for doing it we could be off with a minute’s
notice.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I took pains to make sure that there was a clear
and uninterrupted stretch of water in front of our
hangar,” said Frank. “No vessels are allowed to
anchor on this side of the harbor, though there are
many transports from Great Britain across the way
that have brought men and war material and stores
over.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_27' id='Page_27'>27</a></span>
“Oughtn’t Pudge be about due by now, Frank? It’s
pitch dark outside, and I should think a full hour must
have crept by since he left us?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was thinking of that myself, Billy. Still, we
must remember that our chum is a bit slow on his
legs, compared with the way you and I get over the
ground. Besides, he may have been delayed at the
store where he expects to get the new padlock.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I hadn’t thought of that,” admitted Billy.
“But we might use the ’phone we have installed, and
find out if he’s started back. It would make our
minds a little more easy, you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just as you say, Billy. And suppose you call them
up while I do something I want to alter here—nothing
of consequence, of course, but the change would
strike my eye better.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right, Frank.” With which remark Billy
turned to one end of the hangar close by, where a
telephone apparatus could be seen attached to the
wooden wall.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank went at his little task with his customary
vim. It mattered nothing to him that the flight of
the great seaplane would be neither hindered nor
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_28' id='Page_28'>28</a></span>
assisted by its consummation. He simply liked to see
things shipshape at all times.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s the matter, Billy?” he called out presently,
on hearing the other ring for the third time, and also
muttering to himself as though annoyed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, Frank, I don’t seem able to get Central,”
replied Billy, once more energetically working the
handle of the apparatus.</p>

<p class='c009'>Apparently Frank was enough interested to cross
over so as to see for himself what was wrong. He
sat down on the box Billy vacated and tried to get
in touch with the operator at the central switchboard.
After testing it in several ways, Frank replaced the
receiver and looked up at his chum.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have they disconnected our wire at Central, do
you think, Frank; or is the hello girl flirting with her
beau, and not paying attention to business?” asked
Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Neither,” answered the other soberly; “but I’m
afraid somebody has cut our wire so as to keep us
from calling for help if anything happens here to-night!”</p>

  <h2 id='chIII' class='c010'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <br />SAVING THE GREAT SEAPLANE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Gee whillikins! that sounds like a serious proposition,
Frank!” exclaimed Billy Barnes, when he
heard the opinion of his companion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It looks as though we’re up against something,”
admitted the other grimly. “They’ve evidently set
out to capture this seaplane, and mean to do it, no
matter at what cost.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A compliment from the Kaiser to the ingenuity
of Yankee inventors, I’d call it,” said Billy; “but
all the same I don’t feel like throwing up my hands
and letting them raid our shop here. It’s a good
thing we made that discovery, thanks to Pudge and
his sharp eyes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, and that you thought to use the wire, which
showed us how somebody had been meddling so as
to cut us off from the city,” Frank remarked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What if they come in force, knowing we’re here,
Frank?”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_30' id='Page_30'>30</a></span>
“That door would not be able to stand much of
an attack if they carried axes along with them, I’m
afraid,” Billy was told.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My stars! do you think they’d be apt to do that
sort of thing?” demanded the astonished assistant,
as he looked around for some sort of weapon with
which he might defend the passage of the doorway,
should it come to a question of fighting.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If they want this plane as badly as we think they
do,” said Frank, “there is little that desperate men
might attempt that they would not try.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And still there’s no sign of poor Pudge!” ventured
Billy, putting considerable emphasis on the adjective,
as though he could almost imagine the happy-go-lucky
Pudge lying on his back somewhere along
the road, groaning in pain after having been struck
down by a cowardly blow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m sorry to agree with you,” Frank admitted
slowly, “but at the worst we’ll hope they’re only detaining
our chum, and that he hasn’t been hurt.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How about my slipping out and trying to go for
help, Frank? If they only knew at Headquarters
about this, they would send a whole regiment of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_31' id='Page_31'>31</a></span>
British Tommies on the run to patrol our works
here. Say the word and I’m off.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank, however, shook his head as though the
idea did not appeal to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The chances are they would be on the lookout
for something like that, Billy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And lay for me, you mean, don’t you, Frank?
Well, then, if it wasn’t so cold I’d propose slipping
down to the water and doing a little swimming stunt.
Too bad we didn’t think to have a boat of some kind
with us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was just thinking,” ventured Frank, “that only
on account of our being rushed for time we would
have installed a wireless plant here, as we’ve often
done before. Then we could send all the messages
we wanted, and these spies wouldn’t be able to bother
with them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, if we had only thought we’d run against a
snag like this, Frank, we could have done that as
easy as falling off a log. But it’s too late now to
bother. The question is, what can we do about it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s always one last resort that I know of,
Billy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_32' id='Page_32'>32</a></span>
“Glad to know it, but please inform me as to its
nature, won’t you, Frank? I would give half of
my year’s salary just to be able to snap my fingers
in the faces of these smart secret agents of the envious
Germans who want to steal our thunder.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank turned and pointed straight at the big seaplane.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s the answer, Billy!” he said shortly.</p>

<p class='c009'>At first the other simply stared as though unable
to grasp the meaning of Frank’s words. Then a
sudden gleam of gathering intelligence began to show
itself in his eyes; he emphatically brought down his
fist in the open palm of his other hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wow! that’s sure the ticket, Frank!” he burst
out with, his enthusiasm spreading until his face
was one solid grin. “We’ve got a way of escape
right in our grip, and I was so blind as not to see it.
Run off in the plane, of course, and leave the smarties
to bite their fingernails. Great head, Frank! These
German spies may think themselves wide-awake, but
they’ll have to get up bright and early in the morning
to catch two Yankee boys napping, believe me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Listen, Billy!”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_33' id='Page_33'>33</a></span>
“Did you think you heard something then, Frank?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s someone at the door yonder; I saw it
move, but the bar kept it from giving way,” Frank
went on in a low tone. “Don’t act as though you
suspected anything out of the way. They may be
watching us through some peep-holes that have been
bored in the walls. It would be foolish for us to
give our plan away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I understand what you are aiming at, Frank,”
remarked the other, trying hard to appear perfectly
natural, immediately adding under his breath:
“There, I saw the door quiver again. They must
wonder why it refuses to give way. That bar is
our salvation, because like as not there’s a number
of them out there who would flock in with all sorts
of weapons, meaning to keep us quiet while their
aviators examine the machine and get ready for a
launching. Whee! then good-by to our bully <em>Sea
Eagle</em> forever.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’ll never happen as long as we can lift a
hand to prevent it,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say, you don’t think that could be Pudge trying
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_34' id='Page_34'>34</a></span>
the door?” suggested Billy, as though struck by a
sudden bright idea.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not very likely,” came the reply; “but we can
easily tell. If he hears me give our old signal, Pudge
will answer on the dot. Listen and see if anything
comes of it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The whistle Frank emitted was of a peculiar character.
It was immediately imitated from without,
and so exactly that one might think it an echo. Frank
shook his head on hearing this.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pudge isn’t there,” he said decisively. “If he
was, as you very well know, Billy, he would have
sent back the other call, entirely different from the
one I gave.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then some fellow answered for Pudge, thinking
we might open up, when they could rush the place
and get possession—is that the way it stands, Frank?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“As near as I can make out, it covers the ground,”
the young air pilot replied. “Now I’m going to put
out this light. We don’t really need it any longer,
and if they are watching us through any peep-holes,
it would give our plan away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We ought to know every part of this coop,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_35' id='Page_35'>35</a></span>
Frank. As for the machine itself, I warrant you
could find any stay or guy while it’s pitch dark. Let
it go. There, they are trying the door again. Seems
as if they can’t understand why it doesn’t give way.
If it keeps on shutting them out, sooner or later
they’ll try to batter it down. Oh! if I only had a
gun here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I intended having one with the seaplane, but
thought I wouldn’t bother until we meant to start
on a trip,” explained Frank, keen regret in his voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Seems to me it’s always the unexpected that keeps
cropping up with us,” complained Billy. “I can look
back to lots of times when things happened just as
suddenly and without warning as this has.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But they didn’t down us, you want to remember,”
advised the other, in that confident way of his
that always made his chums feel so much better.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now they’re starting to pry at the doors, Frank,
which means business. Hadn’t we better be getting
ready to make a start?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“First of all I want you to stand by, and when I
give the word fling both the large doors wide open,”
Frank told him. “After that, as I switch on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_36' id='Page_36'>36</a></span>
searchlight, so as to see what lies ahead, climb aboard
to your regular place. And, Billy, please don’t have
any hitch in the program if you can help it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Depend on me, Frank,” said the other, slipping
away in the darkness that now filled the interior of
the big hangar.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank mounted to his seat. As no flight of consequence
was intended, he did not bother donning
the head shield he always carried with the machine,
his gloves alone being deemed necessary for the occasion,
though both of them had wisely secured their
fleece-lined leather jackets. Just as Billy had said,
Frank was so familiar with every lever and stay, as
well as with the engine, that, with his eyes blindfolded,
he could have manipulated the intricate working
parts.</p>

<p class='c009'>Quickly he adjusted things to his liking with a deftness
that left nothing to be desired. The fact that
those unseen parties on the other side of the door were
becoming more insistent with every passing second did
not seem to disturb Frank at all; for he knew very
well they could not stop his departure now.</p>

<p class='c009'>When, presently, he had finished his simple
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_37' id='Page_37'>37</a></span>
preparations and everything was ready for the grand finale,
he gave the signal that Billy was expectantly awaiting.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Open up, Billy!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Immediately both wide doors flew back, for the
boys had arranged things so that it required but a
simple movement to accomplish this. Then Billy
hustled toward the seaplane, which no longer stood
there like a black shadow; for Frank had, with the
pressure of his finger, caused the powerful searchlight
placed in the bow of the remarkable craft to
flood the space in front of the hangar down to and
out on the water of the harbor.</p>

<p class='c009'>Billy swung himself aboard almost in the twinkling
of an eye. Then a lever was manipulated and with
a rush the monster seaplane started. Even as it left
the shelter of the building, Billy, hanging on with
nervous hands, could see several figures in the dazzling
flood of white light spring wildly aside so as
to avoid being crushed by the oncoming giant seaplane
as it tore down the inclined track leading to
the water.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_38' id='Page_38'>38</a></span>
  <h2 id='chIV' class='c010'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <br />THE ESCAPE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Ahead of them lay that track of dazzling light.
Every fragment of timber used in the construction
of the inclined trestle upon which the seaplane was
expected to reach the water was as plainly visible as
at midday, with the sun shining above.</p>

<p class='c009'>Billy fairly held his breath in fear lest the swift
rush of the hydro-aëroplane should catch the two men
on the slope unprepared, and hurl them into space.
Just in the nick of time they threw themselves to
one side, and the plunging monster glided by, so close
that had he so willed, Billy could have thrust out
a hand and touched one of the shrinking figures.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then came a tremendous splash as they struck the
water. Frank had made his calculations so carefully
that there was not the slightest danger of a mishap.
The boat was descending at such an angle that it instantly
shot off the wheels that were underneath, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_39' id='Page_39'>39</a></span>
skimmed along the surface of the water like a great
duck.</p>

<p class='c009'>Billy drew his breath again, for it seemed as though
they had actually run the gauntlet in safety. He
heard the familiar throb of the reliable motors beginning
to take up their sweet song, which told that
Frank had started the machinery at the proper second,
so that they did not lose any of the impetus gained
in that rush down the slope.</p>

<p class='c009'>From up in the quarter where they knew the hangar
must be, came loud cries of anger. Those who had
planned to capture the seaplane when it was in prime
condition for a flight to the German lines had evidently
met with a most aggravating disappointment.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly the brilliant light vanished, shutting them
in a pall of darkness that was all the more dense
because of their having been staring into that illuminated
avenue ahead, along which the seaplane was
rushing at fair speed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s all clear in front, Billy,” Frank hastened to
say, knowing that his companion must naturally think
of the danger of a collision the first thing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Listen to ’em growl!” chuckled Billy, who had
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_40' id='Page_40'>40</a></span>
evidently been greatly amused as well as interested in
the remarkable dash of the <em>Sea Eagle</em>. “But, after
all, that was what I’d call a close shave, Frank. Didn’t
you hear the door being smashed in as we started?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thought I did,” replied the other, “but I knew
that nothing up there could give us any trouble. The
only chance of our being wrecked was for those on
the inclined plane to place some obstruction on the
track that would throw the wheels of our carriage off,
and dump us in a heap below.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They didn’t want to wreck the seaplane, which
was what saved us from that smashup,” ventured
Billy, and then quickly adding: “Hello! shut her off,
did you, Frank?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The musical hum of the twin motors and the whir
of the revolving propellers had suddenly ceased,
though the boat still continued to move along the
top of the little waves coming in from the Channel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, we have gone far enough for the present,”
replied the pilot.</p>

<p class='c009'>They sat there for a little while, listening to the
various sounds that reached their ears from the
shore. Not far away the lights of Dunkirk could be
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_41' id='Page_41'>41</a></span>
seen, though these were by no means as brilliant as
they might have been before the war broke out. This
was on account of the fact that at any hour a raid
from German aëroplanes might be expected in and
around the encampment of the British troops.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is about the queerest situation we’ve ever
found ourselves in, Frank,” ventured Billy presently,
as he felt the boat moving up and down gently on the
bosom of the sea. “It’s an experience we’ll never forget.
I’m wondering what the next move on the
program is going to be? How can we get ashore tonight
in this terrible darkness?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We may make up our minds not to try it,” Frank
told him quietly, as though he had some sort of plan
in his mind, hatched on the spur of the moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s the idea, Frank?” asked Billy eagerly. “No
matter how you figure it I’m game to stand by you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’d never question that, Billy,” declared the other
warmly. “You’ve proved your grit many a time
in the past. But here’s the way the case stands. We
could make an ascent from the water if we wanted,
but on such a pitch-dark night that would mean trouble
about coming down again. So what’s to hinder our
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_42' id='Page_42'>42</a></span>
staying here until morning—lying on the water like
a duck?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If the wind doesn’t come up with the change in
the tide, we could do it as easy as anything,” assented
Billy. “She rides like a duck, and could stand a
lot more rough water than we’re getting now. Frank,
let’s call it a go.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We will find it pretty cold, of course, you understand,
Billy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Shucks! haven’t we got on our leather jackets that
are lined with fleece that have given us solid comfort
many a time when we were six thousand feet and
more up in the cold air? Why, Frank, we can strap
ourselves to our seats, you know, and one of us can
get a few winks of sleep while the other watches,
ready to switch on the searchlight if anything
threatens.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s plain to be seen that you’re set on trying a
night of it,” said Frank, no doubt well pleased to have
it so. “I’m worrying more about Pudge than of myself.
Wish we knew he was all right.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The same here,” said Billy. “Frank, we must
keep listening all through the night to catch his
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_43' id='Page_43'>43</a></span>
signal, if ever he makes it. You know we’ve got that
code for communicating by means of fish horns. If
Pudge gets to the hangar and finds that we’re not
around, the first thing he’ll think will be that the seaplane
has been stolen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Unless,” Frank hastily interrupted, “he happened
to be near enough to hear something of the row,
when he ought to be able to guess what really happened.
In that case I expect that later on, when he
thinks the coast may be clear, Pudge will try to communicate
with us. As you say, we must keep on
the alert. If you hear a sound that comes stealing
from far away on the shore and resembles the bawl
of a bull, answer it. Pudge will be in a stew about us,
of course.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They sat there for some time listening, and exchanging
occasional remarks. Then, at Billy’s suggestion,
they made use of the stout straps that were
attached to each seat, intended to enable the navigators
of the air to reduce to a minimum the risk of
falling from a dizzy height.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Take your choice, Frank, first watch or second,”
was the next proposition advanced by the one-time
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_44' id='Page_44'>44</a></span>
reporter. “I’m used to be up at all hours of the night—<em>that</em>
was my busy time on the paper. So turn in,
and I’ll take charge of the deck.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’ll only be a cat nap then, Billy,” said the other,
settling himself as comfortably as the conditions allowed,
which was not saying much. “See that bright
star over there in the west; it will drop behind the
horizon in about an hour or so. Shake me then if
I happen to be asleep.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right, Frank. And if anything crops up in
the meantime that bothers me, I’m going to disturb
you in a hurry.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope you will, Billy; we can’t afford to take
any chances, understand, for the sake of a little sleep.
Listen for signs of Pudge. It would relieve me a
whole lot if I knew that he was safe.”</p>

<p class='c009'>After that Billy sat there and kept watch. The
buoyant craft that had been so cleverly constructed
so as to be equally at home on the water or in the
air, rode the lazy billows that came rolling in from
the Channel. The only sounds Billy could hear close
by were the constant lapping of the waves against
the side of the craft; though further off, toward the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_45' id='Page_45'>45</a></span>
city, there was a half subdued murmur, such as might
accompany the gathering of thousands of men in
camp.</p>

<p class='c009'>The lights had almost wholly vanished by this time,
showing the strict discipline that was in vogue in
these stirring times. Frequently had daring German
aviators appeared above Dunkirk to drop their bombs
in the endeavor to damage the congested stores of
the British troops, or strike a note of terror among
the inhabitants of the Channel city.</p>

<p class='c009'>Billy every little while twisted his head around and
looked in different directions. But thick darkness lay
about the floating seaplane, utterly concealing the
shore as well as all vessels that lay further along in
the harbor.</p>

<p class='c009'>Possibly half an hour had passed in this way when
Billy felt a sudden thrill. He started up, straining
his hearing, as though to catch the repetition of
some sound he believed he had heard.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then, leaning over, he shook Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s Pudge signaling, Frank, or else I’m away off
my base. Listen!” was what he told the other, in
excited tones.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_46' id='Page_46'>46</a></span>
A minute later and they both caught the far-away
sound of what seemed to be the winding blast of an
Alpine hunter’s horn.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, it’s Pudge, all right, and he wants to hear
from us if we’re within reach of the sound of his
signal. Answer him, Billy!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Already Billy had taken the horn from its fastenings,
and no sooner had Frank given the order
than he applied it to his lips. The sound that went
forth, coming as it did from the blackness of the sea
beyond, must have astonished any sailor on board
the various steamers in the harbor.</p>

<p class='c009'>Once, twice, three times did Billy give the peculiar
note that Pudge knew so well. It must tell the absent
chum that they were safe, and in the language
of their secret code ask how things were going with
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There, he’s given us back the message word for
word!” cried Billy, as they caught the faint but positive
reply from the unseen shore, perhaps at the deserted
hangar. “Frank, he’s all right! That takes a
big load off our minds.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, now I can rest easy!” declared the other.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_47' id='Page_47'>47</a></span>
“As that star isn’t close to the sea as yet, Billy, if
you don’t mind, I think I’ll try for a few more winks
of sleep. Pudge will go back to town and stay at
our lodgings until we turn up, or send him a message.
Everything is working finely.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“For us,” added Billy, chuckling. “But think how
mad those spies must be over losing the prize they
thought was sure to fall into their hands. Why, I
wouldn’t be surprised if they discounted the capture
of our seaplane, and over in Belgium were ready to
start to work making copies of the same as soon as
the sample could be delivered.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Billy appeared to be highly amused, for he chuckled
to himself for several minutes while picturing the disappointment
of the baffled plotters. Then once more
he settled down to his task of serving as “officer of
the watch.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As the minutes crept on, Billy began to observe the
gradual approach of the star to the vague region
where sea and heavens merged in one. In fact, Billy
was yawning quite frequently now. He found himself
fairly comfortable, thanks to the warmth of that
leather fleece-lined jacket, and the hood which he
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_48' id='Page_48'>48</a></span>
had drawn partly over his head. Still, it was not
very delightful, sitting there on the water; and perhaps
the boy’s thoughts frequently turned toward the
bed he was missing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wonder which way we’re drifting now?” he
suddenly asked himself; he immediately set to work
trying to answer his question by observing the direction
of the tide, as well as by the light current
of air.</p>

<p class='c009'>When next he thought to turn his head so as to
glance backward, Billy received a bit of a shock. A
sort of thin haze had settled down on the water by
now, but through this he had discovered two moving
lights. They looked very queer as seen in that foggy
atmosphere; but Billy was smart enough to know
what they stood for.</p>

<p class='c009'>He immediately awoke Frank, whispering the astonishing
news in his ear.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_49' id='Page_49'>49</a></span>
  <h2 id='chV' class='c010'>CHAPTER V.<br /> <br />A NIGHT ON THE CHANNEL.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“They’re looking for us, and they’ve got lanterns,
Frank!” was what the one on guard said in a low
tone as he pulled his chum’s sleeve.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank was wide-awake instantly, and one quick
glance showed him the approaching peril.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, you’re right about it, Billy,” he observed cautiously,
and if there was a little quiver to his voice
that was no more than might be expected under the
exciting conditions by which they were surrounded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How queer the lights look swinging along close
to the water, and in that fog, too. They are heading
out this way, I’m afraid, Frank.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It seems so, Billy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hadn’t we better get under way, then?” continued
the nervous one.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No hurry,” Frank told him. “They may happen
to swing around one way or the other and miss us.
We’ll wait and find out. You know we can get
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_50' id='Page_50'>50</a></span>
moving with a second’s warning. Now let’s watch and
see what happens.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Billy could be heard sighing every now and then.
Doubtless, as he sat there with his head turned halfway
around, observing the creeping movements of
those two strange lights through the fog that hugged
the surface of the water, he was thinking it the most
exciting moment of his whole career.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then a new idea seemed to have lodged in his
brain, for again he whispered to his companion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There may be more than those two boats, Frank!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Possible but not probable,” Frank replied.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What if, when we started off with a rush, one happened
to get in the way?” pursued Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’d be sorry for the men in that boat, that’s all,
Billy!” was the laconic reply he received, and apparently
it satisfied the other, for he did not pursue
the subject any further.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile it became apparent that the searching
boats were gradually drawing nearer the floating seaplane.
Unless they changed their course very soon
those in the hostile craft would be likely to make
a discovery that must fill them with delight.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_51' id='Page_51'>51</a></span>
“Are we headed right for a start, Frank?” asked
Billy, a minute later.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank himself had been considering that very thing.
The influence of the tide seemed to have swung the
seaplane around a little more than he liked; but then
this could be easily remedied, for they were prepared
for such a possibility when on the water.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a little paddle within reach of Frank’s
hand; all he had to do was to pull a couple of cords,
and it was in his possession.</p>

<p class='c009'>Softly he worked it through the water. Frank
had spent many happy hours in a canoe when on his
outing trips, and knew how to wield a paddle like
an expert. He had even taken lessons from one of
those old-time guides accustomed, in years gone by,
to using a birch bark canoe in stealing up on deer
when jacklight hunting was not banned by the law.</p>

<p class='c009'>Consequently he now used his paddle without making
the slightest noise; and under its magic influence
the clumsy craft gradually veered until he had its
spoon-shaped bow heading just where he wanted it.
Then he handed the paddle to Billy to replace as
best he might.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_52' id='Page_52'>52</a></span>
They could by this time vaguely make out the nearer
boat, and also the indistinct figures of two men. One
of these was rowing, while the other held up the
lantern.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of course, there was nothing to tell Frank who
they might be. Perhaps, in these stirring times, the
waters of the harbor had to be patrolled by guards
on the watch for submarines or other perils. These
protectors of shipping may have heard or seen enough
that was suspicious to warrant a search of the adjacent
waters.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was more inclined to believe, however, that the
German spies, rendered furious by the escape of the
coveted American seaplane had, as a last resort, started
out to scour the water nearby in hopes of locating it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Frank!” whispered Billy again, “I think he
glimpses the seaplane through the fog!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The actions of the man holding the lantern indicated
this, for he was plainly much excited, turning
to his companion at the oars as though urging him
to make more haste.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then it’s high time we were off!” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>Again did Billy hold his breath as the possibility
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_53' id='Page_53'>53</a></span>
of the motors failing them in this great emergency
flashed through his mind. But he need not have
allowed himself this mental anxiety, for no such
calamity befell them.</p>

<p class='c009'>A shrill whistle was heard, evidently a signal to
those in the second boat to inform them that the object
of their search had been discovered. Then came
the cheery whirr of the motors, accompanied by the
churn of the busy propellers, and like a giant, double-winged
dragonfly, the seaplane started along the surface
of the water, followed by another burst of angry
shouts.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Duck! they may be going to shoot!” exclaimed
Frank, suiting his actions to his own words.</p>

<p class='c009'>That was just what did happen, for a volley of
shots sounded, and had the motors not been making
so much noise the boys might have heard the whistle
of the passing leaden messengers.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no harm done, for, unable to longer see
the speeding seaplane, those who used their weapons
with such reckless abandon had to fire at random.
Skimming the water like an aquatic bird, with a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_54' id='Page_54'>54</a></span>
gradual but rapid increase to their speed, the seaplane
soon began to rise.</p>

<p class='c009'>Billy realized from that that Frank meant to make an
ascension, possibly deeming it wise to get away from
such a dangerous neighborhood as quickly as possible.
And, as they anticipated, the reliable <em>Sea
Eagle</em> was doing her prettiest when called upon to
show her fine points.</p>

<p class='c009'>Once free from the sea, they rose until Frank felt
sure of his position. He had switched on the electric
searchlight, and the storage battery was of sufficient
power to send the ray of white light far ahead. It
could be turned to any quarter of the compass.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, here we are off on our trial trip sooner
than we expected,” said Billy, meaning to draw the
other out, for he was consumed by curiosity to know
what was coming next.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Two narrow squeaks on one night ought to be
enough, don’t you think, Billy?” asked the pilot, as
he started out into that avenue of light, and then
glanced at the handy compass so as to fix their course
on his mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, we’ve been pretty lucky so far,” admitted
the other. “It wouldn’t pay to keep up that sort of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_55' id='Page_55'>55</a></span>
racket. They say, you know, that the pitcher may
go to the well just once too often. It might be three
times and out for us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And neither of us feels like accommodating those
anxious German secret agents whose one business in
Dunkirk is to steal our thunder, do we, Billy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not much,” replied the other boy with decided
emphasis. “I’d sooner see the airship smashed to
pieces than know it had fallen into the hands of the
Kaiser’s men.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hold on, Billy! You know we’re supposed to be
neutral in this fighting business. We’ve got some
mighty good friends who are of German blood, and
we think a whole lot of them, too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! I’m not saying a word against Germans;
they’re as fine a people as any in all the world; but,
Frank, what we’ve met with in Northern France and
in the little of Belgium we saw that day Major Nixon
took us out in his motor car, somehow set me against
the invaders. Anyway, we’ve been treated splendidly
by the French here, and our business has been with
them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s understood, Billy, and I agree with you in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_56' id='Page_56'>56</a></span>
all you say. But let’s talk now about our chances
of dropping down again to the water.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! then you don’t mean to stay up here, Frank?
Will it be safe to descend, do you think?” asked Billy,
a new sense of anxiety gripping him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So far as the plane is concerned we can do almost
anything with it,” Frank assured him. “Our light
will tell us whether the sea is too rough for alighting.
We’re heading downward as it is right now. Steady,
Billy, and keep on the watch.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Having taken his course, Frank knew that they
must be out on the channel some miles from the harbor.
On nine nights out of ten he would have hesitated
about attempting such a risky proceeding as he now
had in view; but the calmness that prevailed encouraged
him to take the chances of a descent in the
darkness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can see the water all right, Frank!” exclaimed
Billy a minute later, as the wonderful air and water
craft continued to head downward, though with but
a gradual descent.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It looks good to me,” ventured the pilot, with
confidence in his tone.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_57' id='Page_57'>57</a></span>
Presently they were so close to the surface of the
water that both of the boys could see that it was
fairly quiet. The long rollers were steadily moving
toward the southeast, as though the night air influenced
them, but then Frank had before now dropped
down on the sea when it was much more boisterous.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here goes!” he remarked, as he deflected the
rudder just a trifle more, and immediately they struck
the water.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <em>Sea Eagle</em>, being especially constructed for this
sort of work, and having a spoon bow that would
not allow her to dip deeply, started along on the surface,
with the motors working at almost their lightest
speed. Then Frank cut off all power.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We did it handsomely, Frank!” exulted Billy
Barnes, feeling quite relieved now that the seaplane
had proven fit and right for the business it had been
built to demonstrate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And here we are floating again,” said Frank, “but
this time so far away from the harbor of Dunkirk
that there’s no longer any danger from spies. Billy,
since that star has dipped behind the horizon, suppose
you take your little twenty winks of sleep.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_58' id='Page_58'>58</a></span>
“You think it’s perfectly safe to lie here the rest
of the night, do you, Frank?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why not, when we can get away if the wind
should come up, and the sea prove too rough for us?
Make your mind easy on that score, Billy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But how about steamers crossing from the other
side of the channel?” asked Billy. “I think I heard
that they generally take the night to make the trip
these times, so as to keep the German aviators from
learning how many transports loaded with troops
come over. Besides, they avoid danger from submarines,
and bombs dropped from Zeppelins that
way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! the chances of our being run down are so
small that we needn’t bother about them,” Frank assured
the nervous chum. “I promise you that if I
see a moving light, or hear the propeller of a steamer,
I’ll wake you up, and we can stand by, ready to go
aloft in case the worst threatens.”</p>

<p class='c009'>That seemed to appease Billy, for he gave a satisfied
grunt and proceeded to settle himself for a nap.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is being ‘rocked in the cradle of the deep,’
all right,” he remarked, as the floating seaplane rose
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_59' id='Page_59'>59</a></span>
and fell on the swell. Frank made no reply, so that
presently Billy relapsed into silence, his regular breathing
telling the other he was sound asleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>So the long night crept on. The boys managed to
catch more or less sleep, for nothing arose to alarm
them. Naturally, their position was far from a comfortable
one, and therefore Frank, who happened to
be on duty at the time, felt pleased more than words
could tell when he eventually glimpsed a light in the
eastern sky that proclaimed the coming of dawn.</p>

  <h2 id='chVI' class='c010'>CHAPTER VI.<br /> <br />UNDER SHRAPNEL FIRE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Have we anything to eat along with us, Frank?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, hello! are you awake, Billy? I was just
thinking of calling you, or sending a bell hop up to
pound on your door. It’s morning, you see.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I noticed that light over there in the east,
and was thinking how the poor fellows in the trenches
must feel when they see it creeping on, knowing as
they do that it means another day of hard work and
fighting. But how about my question, Frank? Did
we think to fetch that pouch of ship-biscuit along
with us?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, it’s tied just back of you,” the other informed
him with a laugh. “But I’m surprised to hear you
so keen for a bite, Billy. If it had been Pudge, now,
I wouldn’t have thought so much about it, because
he’s always ready for six meals a day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know what ails me,” acknowledged the
other, as he reached for the little waterproof bag in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_61' id='Page_61'>61</a></span>
which Frank always tried to keep a pound or so of
hardtack, with some cheese as well, to provide for
any emergency like the present, “it may be this sea
air, or perhaps it’s due to the excitement we’ve gone
through; but I’m as hungry as a wolf in winter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps I may take your appetite away then,”
suggested Frank, with a chuckle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In what way?” demanded Billy, with a round ship
biscuit halfway to his mouth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! by making a stunning proposition I’ve been
considering while I sat here, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gee! it takes you to think up things, Frank. Now,
as for me, I’ve been badgering my poor brains about
how we would astonish the people of Dunkirk when
we came sailing into the harbor and made for our
hangar. There’d be as much excitement as if a
dozen of those little Taube aëroplanes of the Germans
had hove in sight, just as they did on that day of
the last air raid. Now tell me what the game is,
please, Frank.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Suppose, then, we weren’t in such a big hurry to
go back to our moorings?” said the other. “Suppose,
that having broken away, we took that trial spin we’ve
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_62' id='Page_62'>62</a></span>
always been promising ourselves when things were
ready!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Billy became so excited that he actually forgot to
eat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wow! that’s a brilliant scheme, Frank, let me tell
you!” he exclaimed. “Say, for a wonder, all the conditions
favor aëroplane work. The wind that has kept
up during the last three days seems to have blown
itself out, and we’re likely to have a quiet spell.
They’ll be on the watch for another raid of those
Taubes from up Antwerp way on such a calm day
as this. Frank, shall we try it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wait for another half hour,” replied the other.
“By then it will be broad daylight, and we can see
what the signs promise. If things look good we’ll
start up and take a run to the northeast.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Over the trenches, do you mean, and perhaps far
into Belgium?” cried Billy, to whom the prospect
of seeing something of the terrible fighting that was
daily taking place in the lowlands along the canal
appealed with irresistible force; for the old reporter
spirit had never been killed when he gave up newspaper
work for aëroplane building.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_63' id='Page_63'>63</a></span>
“We’ll see how the land lies,” was all Frank would
say. Billy knew very well the other was bound to
be just as keenly interested in the warlike scenes below
them as he could be, hence he was willing to check
his impatience, leaving everything to Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>Both of them munched away on the ship-biscuit and
cheese. It was pretty dry fare, but then there was
a bottle of water at hand if they felt choking at any
time.</p>

<p class='c009'>The half hour passed and they could see from the
growing light in the eastern sky that the sun would
soon be making its appearance. Around them there
was nothing but an endless succession of rollers, upon
which the buoyant seaplane rose and fell with a continual
gurgling sound.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If this low-hanging fog would only lift,” remarked
Billy, as he put away the hardtack bags, “we could
tell just where we were. As it is, there’s no such
thing as seeing land, which must be over there to
the east.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The sea fog is rising and will disappear as soon
as the breeze comes,” Frank observed sagaciously.
“By then we want to be several thousand feet up,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_64' id='Page_64'>64</a></span>
and taking a look through the glasses at the picture
we’ll have spread out below us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s start now,” suggested Billy. “I’m wild to see
what the country up across the border of Belgium
looks like. To think of us being able to glimpse all
the German defenses as we go sailing over so
smoothly.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank laughed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are counting your chickens again before
they’re hatched, Billy, an old failing of yours. It
may not be the smooth sailing you think. Remember
that the Germans are always ready-primed with their
wonderful anti-aëroplane guns for hostile raiders.
We may have a dozen Taubes, too, buzzing after us,
or find ourselves chased into the clouds by a big Zeppelin.”</p>

<p class='c009'>If Frank thought to alarm Billy by saying this, he
immediately saw that he had failed to shake the other’s
nerve.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gee! that would make it interesting, for a fact!”
the other exclaimed, his face beaming with eagerness.
“Frank, you can take my word for it, no Taube, or
Zeppelin either, for that matter, can catch up with
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_65' id='Page_65'>65</a></span>
our good old <em>Sea Eagle</em>, once you crack on all of her
two thousand revolutions a minute with both motors.
They haven’t got a thing over on this side of the big
pond that is in the same class with Doctor Perkins’s
invention.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think you’re pretty near right there, Billy,” said
the pilot, as he proceeded to press the button that
would start things humming.</p>

<p class='c009'>Immediately they were beginning to move along on
the surface, the peculiar spoon-shaped bow preventing
the water from coming aboard. Faster went the
huge seaplane as Frank gave increased power, until
when he tilted the ascending rudder they left the water
just as a frightened duck does after attaining sufficient
momentum.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hurrah!” exclaimed the delighted Billy, as soon
as he realized, from the change in motion, that they
no longer rested on the water, but were cleaving the
air.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mounting in spirals, as usual, the two boys soon
began to have a splendid view, not only of the sea,
but of the nearby land as well.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! look, Frank, over there in the west; those
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_66' id='Page_66'>66</a></span>
must be the famous white chalk cliffs of Dover across
the channel we see. To think that we are looking
down at France, and even Belgium, and on England
at the same time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s about where the Kaiser is aiming to throw
those monster shells from his big forty-two centimeter
guns, after he has captured Calais, you know,”
remarked Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I guess that dream’s been smashed by now, and
there’s nothing in it,” Billy was saying. “Not that
the Germans didn’t try mighty hard to get there, and
tens of thousands of their brave fellows gave up their
lives to carry out a whim of the commander, which
might not have amounted to much, after all. Oh!
Frank, with the glass here I can see our hangar as
easy as anything.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s good, Billy. I was just going to ask you
to look and see if those disappointed spies had done
anything to it. I’m glad to hear you say it’s still
there in good shape. I expect we’ll have more or less
need of that shed from time to time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, we don’t mean to spend many nights paddling
around on the sea,” affirmed Billy, now
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_67' id='Page_67'>67</a></span>
beginning to turn his glass upon the country they were
approaching, and which lay to the north of Dunkirk.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank had changed their course so that they were
now over the land. They could easily see the camps
of the British troops, though they were so far above
them that moving companies looked like marching
ants. The tents could not be concealed, and there
were besides numerous low sheds, which doubtless
sheltered supplies of every description, needed by the
army fighting in the trenches further north.</p>

<p class='c009'>As Frank drew more upon the motors that were
keeping up a noisy chorus, the huge seaplane rushed
through the air and gave them a change of landscape
every little while.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sun was in plain sight, although just beginning
to touch things below with golden fingers. Covering
land and water, they could see over a radius that
must have been far more than fifty miles.</p>

<p class='c009'>Billy kept uttering exclamations, intended to express
the rapture that filled his breast. In all his
experience he had never gazed upon anything to compare
with what he now saw spread out below him
as though upon a monster checkerboard. African
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_68' id='Page_68'>68</a></span>
wilds, Western deserts and Polar regions of eternal
ice were all dwarfed in interest by this spectacle.</p>

<p class='c009'>Again and again did he call the attention of his
chum to certain features of the wonderful picture
that especially appealed to him. Now it was the snakelike
movements of what appeared to be a new army
heading toward the front, accompanied by a long
line of big guns that were drawn by traction engines.
Then the irregular line of what he made out
to be the opposing trenches riveted his attention. He
was thrilled when he actually saw a rush made by
an attacking party of Germans, to be met with volleys
that must have sadly decimated their ranks, for
as Billy gazed with bated breath he saw the remnant
of the gallant band reel back and vanish amidst their
own trenches.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Am I awake, Frank, or asleep and dreaming all
this?” Billy exclaimed, as he handed the glasses to
his chum.</p>

<p class='c009'>This Frank could readily do because they were running
along as smoothly as velvet, and long habit had
made him perfectly at home in handling the working
parts of the seaplane.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_69' id='Page_69'>69</a></span>
“I wonder what they think of us?” wondered
Billy. “You may be sure that every field glass and
pair of binoculars they own is leveled at us right
now. They must think the French or the British
have sprung one on them, to beat out their old Zeppelins
at the raiding business! Oh! wouldn’t I give
something to be close enough to the commanding
general to see the look on his face.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank was looking for something else just then.
Although they were flying at such a great height, he
fancied that the present security would hardly last.
The Germans were only waiting until they had gone
on a certain distance; then probably a dozen of their
hustling little Taube machines would spring upward
and chase after the singular stranger like a swarm of
hornets, seeking to cut off escape, and hoping by some
lucky shot to bring it down.</p>

<p class='c009'>The barograph was in plain sight from where
Frank sat, and perhaps the quick glance he gave at
its readings just then had some connection with this
expectation of coming trouble.</p>

<p class='c009'>Billy interpreted it otherwise. He was afraid
Frank, thinking they had gone far enough, was
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_70' id='Page_70'>70</a></span>
sweeping around to start back toward the British
trench line.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just a little further, Frank,” pleaded Billy.
“There’s a big move on over yonder, seems like, where
that army is coming along; and I’d like to see enough
to interest our good friend Major Nixon when we
get back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know whether I’ll let you say a single
word, Billy,” the air pilot told him, as he relinquished
the glasses to the eager one. “That wouldn’t be acting
neutral, you know. Besides, there are plenty of
the Allies’ machines able to fly, and those airmen like
Graham-White ought to be able to pick up news of
any big movement.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They could see patches of snow in places, and much
water in others where the low country had been inundated
by the Belgians. This was done in hopes of
hastening the retreat of the invaders, who despite
all had stuck to their trenches and the unfinished canal
for months, as though rooted there.</p>

<p class='c009'>All at once there sounded a loud crash not far below
the young air pilots, and a puff of white smoke
told where a shrapnel shell had burst.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_71' id='Page_71'>71</a></span>
“Frank, they’re firing at us!” exclaimed Billy, who
had made an involuntary ducking movement with his
head as the sharp discharge burst upon his ears.</p>

<p class='c009'>Even as he spoke another, and still a third crash
told that the Germans had determined the time was
at hand to try their anti-aëroplane guns on the strange
seaplane that was soaring above the camps.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_72' id='Page_72'>72</a></span>
  <h2 id='chVII' class='c010'>CHAPTER VII.<br /> <br />THE “SEA EAGLE” ON PARADE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“That means we’ll have to climb higher, so that
their guns can’t reach!” Frank immediately decided.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was indeed getting rather warm around them,
Billy thought. The shrapnel puffs seemed to be above,
below, and on every side, and it was a wonder that
neither of them received a wound.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Only for the speed we’re hitting up, the story
might be a whole lot different, according to my notion,
Frank. They have a hard job to get our range,
you see.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, most of it bursts back of us, showing a faulty
figuring,” the pilot explained, as he started a corkscrew
movement of the seaplane calculated to cause
the aircraft to bore upward in spirals.</p>

<p class='c009'>The guns, far below, kept up a merry chorus. Billy
could hear the faint noise made by the continuous
discharges, and the puffs of smoke that seemed to
rise in a score of places at the same time told him
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_73' id='Page_73'>73</a></span>
how eagerly the German gunners were trying to strike
that elevated mark.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now the shrapnel ceased to worry Billy, for he saw
that none of it seemed to be bursting around them
as before. The limits or range of the anti-aircraft
guns had apparently been reached.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’re safe from the iron rain up at this height,
Frank. What does the barometer say?” he asked,
with that spirit of curiosity that had made him a good
reporter in the old days.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s too bad,” replied Frank, as he bent forward
to look.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t tell me that the only fragment of a shell
that’s struck home ruined our fine barometer!” cried
Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just what happened,” he was told. “At any rate,
it’s knocked to flinders; and I think I must have had
a pretty close shave. But we can buy a new one when
we get back to Dunkirk. As near as I can give a
rough guess we must be between three and four thousand
feet high.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should say it was a lot more than that,” Billy
declared. “But so long as they can’t reach us
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_74' id='Page_74'>74</a></span>
any longer, why dispute over a few thousand feet?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He thereupon once more started to make use of
the glasses, and had hardly settled them to his eyes
than he gave a startled cry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Frank, they’re coming up like a swarm of angry
bees!” Billy exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you mean Taube aëroplanes, Billy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I can see as many as six right now in different
directions, and others are going to follow, if looks
count for anything. The word must have been given
to attack us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m not worrying any,” Frank told him calmly.
“In fact, I don’t believe they’ll try to tackle such
a strange hybrid aircraft. They can see how differently
constructed the <em>Sea Eagle</em> is from all other
hydro-aëroplanes, and expect that we must mount at
least one quick-firing gun.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then what are they climbing for, Frank? I can
hear the buzz of their propellers right now, and let
me tell you it sounds like ‘strictly business’ to me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They are meaning to get close enough to let the
pilots see what kind of a queer contrivance it is that’s
hanging over their camps,” Frank continued in a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_75' id='Page_75'>75</a></span>
reassuring manner. “When we choose to turn tail and
clear out, there isn’t one in the lot that can tag on
after us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know that, Frank, thanks to those wonderful
motors, and the clever construction of Dr. Perkins’
model. But now here’s new trouble looming up
ahead.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can see what you mean, Billy. Yes, that is a
Zeppelin moving along down there, one of the older
type, I should say, without having used the glasses.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But surely it will make for us, Frank. A real
Zeppelin wouldn’t think of sheering off from any
sort of aëroplane.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Watch and see what happens,” Billy was told, as
Frank changed their course so as to head straight
for the great dirigible that was floating in space halfway
between their present altitude and the earth that
lay thousands of feet below.</p>

<p class='c009'>The firing had stopped. Probably the German gunners,
having realized the utter futility of trying to
reach the <em>Sea Eagle</em> while it remained at such a dizzy
height, were now watching to see what was about to
take place. Many of them may have pinned great
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_76' id='Page_76'>76</a></span>
faith in the ability of their aircraft to out-maneuver
any similar fliers manipulated by the pilots of the
Allies. They may even have expected to see a stern
chase, with their air fleet in hot pursuit of this remarkable
stranger.</p>

<p class='c009'>If this were really the case, those same observers
were doomed to meet with a bitter disappointment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, what does it look like now?” Frank asked
presently, while his companion continued to keep
the glasses glued to his eyes as though fairly fascinated
by all he saw.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Zeppelin has put on full steam, I should say,
Frank,” admitted Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Coming to attack us?” chuckled the other, though
the motors were humming at such a lively rate that
Billy barely caught the words.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gee whillikins, I should say not!” he cried exultantly.
“Why, they’re on the run, Frank, and going
like hot cakes. I bet you that Zeppelin never
made faster time since the day it was launched. They
act as though they thought we wanted to get above
them so as to bombard the big dirigible with bombs.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And that’s just what they do fear,” said Frank
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_77' id='Page_77'>77</a></span>
positively. “That’s the greatest weakness of those
big dirigibles, they offer such a wide surface for being
hit. While an ordinary shell might pass straight
through, and only tear one of the many compartments,
let a bomb be dropped from above, and explode
on the gas bag, and the chances are the Zeppelin
would go to the scrap-heap.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They’re dropping down in a hurry!” declared
Billy. “There, I can see a great big shed off yonder,
and it must be this that the dirigible is aiming to
reach. We could, however, bombard the shed as
easily, and destroy it together with its contents.
Frank, it makes me think of an ostrich trying to hide
its head in a little patch of grass or weeds, and because
it can’t see anything, believes itself completely
hidden.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, as we haven’t even a gun along with us
the Zeppelin is pretty safe from our attack,” remarked
Frank. “We’ve proved one thing by coming out to-day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I guess you mean that we’ve given the Germans
something to puzzle their wits over, eh, Frank? They
know now that no matter what big yarns have been
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_78' id='Page_78'>78</a></span>
told about the new Yankee seaplane they tried to
steal, it’s all true, every single word of it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Billy seemed to be quite merry over it. The fact
that the dangerous Zeppelin had fled in such wild
haste, shunning an encounter, while the vicious little
Taube aëroplanes darted about like angry hornets, yet
always kept a respectable distance away from the majestic
soaring <em>Sea Eagle</em> was enough to make anyone
feel satisfied.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I admit that at first I was kind of shaky about
defying the whole lot, but I’ve changed my mind
some, Frank,” he called out a minute later. “Yes,
the shoe is on the other foot now. They’re afraid
of us! Makes a fellow puff out with pride. There’s
only one thing I feel sorry about.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What might that be?” asked the other.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If only Harry could have been along to enjoy
this wonderful triumph with us, or Dr. Perkins
either. It would have completed our victory. But
from here I can see that army on the move as plain
as anything. They’re meaning to make one of their
terrible drives somewhere along the Yser Canal,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_79' id='Page_79'>79</a></span>
perhaps when that air raid comes off that we heard so
much quiet talk about.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, that raid may be held up a while,” Frank
told him. “They must believe that French or British
pilots are aboard the <em>Sea Eagle</em> right now; and for all
they know there are half a dozen just such big aircraft
waiting to engage their fleet if it hove in sight
of Dunkirk or Calais.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Every time we make a sweep around you can
see the nearest Taube scuttle off in a big hurry,” ventured
Billy. “Why, Frank, some of those machines
are carrying a quick-firer with them, but they’ve had
orders not to take risks. What would you do if they
actually started to close in on us?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank laughed as though that did not worry him
very much.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, there are several things we could do, Billy.
In the first place we can go higher with the <em>Sea Eagle</em>
than any of those flimsy Taubes would dare to venture,
though I’d hate to risk it in this bitter cold air.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, that’s true, Frank, and like you I hope we
will not have to climb any further. It isn’t so bad
in the summer, but excuse me from doing it now.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_80' id='Page_80'>80</a></span>
We would need two more coats on top of the ones
we’ve got, and another hood to keep our ears from
being frozen stiff. What’s the other idea?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A straight run-away,” explained Frank. “If I
really saw that any of them meant business, I could
crack on all speed until we were making the entire
two thousand revolutions per minute. That would
leave them far behind.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should think so,” admitted Billy, who had the
greatest possible faith in the ability of the seaplane,
as well as the cleverness of its young pilot. “Once
we got to going our prettiest and they would look as
if they might be standing still. Who’s afraid? Set
’em up in the other alley!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think I’ll show them something to start them
guessing,” Frank was saying a minute later. “They
haven’t yet seen what she can do under forced pressure.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let her out to the limit then,” pleaded the passenger,
who could never experience too much excitement.</p>

<p class='c009'>So Frank began to turn on full speed, and the wonderful
creation of Dr. Perkins’ inventive brain was
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_81' id='Page_81'>81</a></span>
soon swooping along in a manner calculated to make
some of those who were staring through glasses far
below gasp with astonishment bordering on awe.</p>

<p class='c009'>After all, Frank Chester was a boy, and must have
felt a natural pride in being able to thus surprise
the whole of the Kaiser’s army with his amazing new
aircraft. He knew that tens of thousands of eyes
must be riveted upon them at that particular moment,
from the officers at Headquarters to the mud-spattered
and half frozen men concealed in the irregular
trenches.</p>

<p class='c009'>“See the Taubes giving us all the room they can,
Frank!” cried Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Evidently they’re not hankering after an engagement
with the <em>Sea Eagle</em>, Billy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They make me think of a flock of wild ducks on
a lake when an eagle poises on fluttering wings above
them, picking out his dinner,” Billy went on to say.
“They scatter and dive and act half crazy; but nearly
every time the eagle gets what he’s after.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, all we want is a clear road back over the
way we came,” the pilot pursued. “Fact is, we’re
not near so dangerous as we look. All we could do
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_82' id='Page_82'>82</a></span>
just now would be to ram a Zeppelin, and go down
with it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But they don’t know that, Frank, which is lucky
for us!” declared his chum.</p>

<p class='c009'>No doubt, Billy, in common with most other boys,
must have learned at school the familiar saying that
“pride always goes before a fall.” He had just been
doing considerable boasting, and his heart was even
then swelling with the conviction that he and his chum
were virtually snapping their fingers at the whole of
the Kaiser’s scattered army with every enlisted man
craning his neck in wonder.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then came the sudden shock, all the more terrifying
because so utterly unexpected. It seemed to
Billy that his very breath was taken away. The joyous
buzz of the motors that had amounted to almost
a shriek ceased as if by magic; and the <em>Sea Eagle</em>,
shooting forward a bit under the impetus of her great
speed, quickly began to volplane toward the earth,
thousands of feet below!</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_83' id='Page_83'>83</a></span>
  <h2 id='chVIII' class='c010'>CHAPTER VIII.<br /> <br />A SAFE RETURN.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Who could blame Billy if he turned ashy pale at
that critical second. He could not believe that this
was any scheme of Frank’s for showing off what the
great seaplane was capable of, though on previous
occasions he had known such a thing to happen.</p>

<p class='c009'>The one terrible conviction that flashed through
his mind was that something had happened to stop
their motors at this great altitude; and that the <em>Sea
Eagle</em> was now, with ever increasing velocity, heading
downward to earth.</p>

<p class='c009'>If they managed, through any degree of dexterity
to escape death, there must always be more or less
chance of the machine being wrecked; and even
though that catastrophe were avoided, it was sure to
fall into the hands of the Germans. Then good-by
to their hopes of keeping its construction a secret.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Frank had been busy meanwhile. He was not
the one to be caught napping by any sudden
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_84' id='Page_84'>84</a></span>
happening. Their present predicament had been accurately
discounted by the clever mind that had invented many
parts of the strange seaplane.</p>

<p class='c009'>No sooner did Frank realize that the motive power
had ceased than, with a quick snap of the hand, he
had turned a valve that was within easy reach.</p>

<p class='c009'>This allowed pure hydrogen gas from one of the
cylinders to rush into the buoyancy devices, which
might be called the crowning triumph along the line
of insurance against accidents connected with Dr.
Perkins’ invention.</p>

<p class='c009'>As if by magic, the upper wings of the aircraft
began to swell until they had all the appearance of
puffed-out mattresses. How the eyes of those who
were watching down below must have grown round
with wonder as they realized that here was something
altogether new. It was also a hitherto unheard-of
device intended to diminish the terrible risk of a
fall ever present with those who go up in aircraft.</p>

<p class='c009'>The swift volplaning had immediately begun to
grow less pronounced, and Billy, feeling that after
all they were not going to drop to the ground, drew
in his first breath since the accident had come about.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_85' id='Page_85'>85</a></span>
Frank was already busily engaged in examining
the stalled motors. So reliable had the same brand
always proven in connection with the <em>Sea Eagle</em> type
of hydro-aëroplane, that Frank could not remember
ever having such an accident occur.</p>

<p class='c009'>They were now floating aimlessly in space, not having
any means of moving save as the wind might
chance to cause the seaplane to drift, much after the
manner of an old-time balloon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can you make the repairs, Frank, or do we have
to hang out the white flag of surrender?” called Billy,
in an agony of fear lest their wonderful tryout cruise
be fated to come to such an ignoble finish.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s nothing terrible the matter,” came the
reassuring reply from the pilot, still working with
feverish haste at the motors. “I think I can get things
working again in a hurry.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! you make me happy by saying that, Frank,”
Billy told him. “I was beginning to think I could
see the inside of a German dungeon, or a firing squad
standing me up against a blank wall. I hope it doesn’t
take long, Frank. There, they start their plagued old
anti-aircraft guns again!”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_86' id='Page_86'>86</a></span>
Indeed, the first heavy crash of breaking shrapnel
not far from the stationary seaplane proved that
Billy’s remark bore the stamp of truth. They had
rushed down with such impetus that before the buoyancy
devices could accomplish the purposes for which
they were intended, the seaplane had once more
dropped within range of the elevated guns below.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now having a stationary target to aim at instead
of one that was making something like sixty, seventy,
or perhaps fully five score miles an hour, the experienced
gunners were very apt to send their shells dangerously
close, so that at any second, fragments from
one, as it burst, might do terrible damage to either
the seaplane’s motors or her daring young pilots.</p>

<p class='c009'>Oh! if Frank could only hurry and repair the motors,
Billy was saying over and over again to himself
as he clung there and tried to keep count of the
numerous sudden puffs of gray or white smoke, indicating
the breaking of the shrapnel shells around
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>What if one of them, better aimed than the rest,
should shatter those buoyant wings that were their
sole means of remaining afloat in the upper air! A
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_87' id='Page_87'>87</a></span>
rush, an agonized sensation of the earth coming up
to meet them, and that would be their last realization
of what life meant.</p>

<p class='c009'>Billy would never forget that frightful agony of
that minute as long as he lived. A minute—why, it
seemed to the shivering boy as though he must have
lived almost a whole year while that furious bombardment
kept up; Frank coolly tinkered with the
motors.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Billy heard his chum calling to him; never
had words sounded one-half so sweet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Got it fixed. Be out of this in a jiffy!” the other
shouted, for there was so much racket around them
that words spoken in an ordinary tone could never
have been heard.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Billy forgot about the crackling shrapnel and
the circling Taubes. He had caught the familiar
whir of the propellers as the motors started once
more upon their work. It was a very soothing sound
to Billy’s wrought up nerves.</p>

<p class='c009'>Immediately the <em>Sea Eagle</em> began to speed forward.
Frank’s first act was to set the suction pump to work
emptying the great wings of gas, and sending it back
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_88' id='Page_88'>88</a></span>
to the reservoir intended for storage purposes. This
was done because they could never hope to attain any
great amount of speed otherwise.</p>

<p class='c009'>When they were falling, the boys had heard what
seemed to be a concerted roar from thousands of lusty
throats below. This they knew had indicated the
sudden delight of the watching and deeply interested
soldiers in the aërial mishap that appeared to have
overtaken the wonderful Yankee invention.</p>

<p class='c009'>These shouts kept up more or less while the anti-aircraft
guns were furiously bombarding the nearly
stationary seaplane; but as soon as the latter started
off again, as though in disdain at their futile efforts,
the noise ceased like magic.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank first of all mounted higher, until none of
the bursting bombs came anywhere near them. Then,
feeling perfectly safe from this danger, he set his
course toward the southwest.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Heading home, are you, Frank?” asked Billy, not
at all disappointed, for their trial spin certainly had
contained enough thrills and dangers to satisfy even
such a greedy lover of adventure as the one-time reporter.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_89' id='Page_89'>89</a></span>
“Yes, we’ve done all we set out to attempt, and a
good deal more into the bargain,” replied Frank, casting
a cautious look to the right and left, not meaning
to be taken off his guard by any venturesome German
pilot aboard a Taube machine, who might risk all in
a last attempt to cripple this amazing seaplane that
outclassed anything they possessed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ve finished pumping the gas back again into
the reservoir, haven’t you, Frank? Do you think
there was much loss?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not a bit more than two per cent., for we’ve tested
that before,” he was informed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They’ve given up the pursuit,” Billy observed
presently, showing that all this while he had been
keeping an eye on those swift flying little Taube machines
that had continued to dart hither and thither,
like angry hornets, yet not daring to make an attack.</p>

<p class='c009'>Since there was no longer any visible sign of danger,
the boys were able to once more observe the
checkerboard picture that lay far below them. Accustomed
to being up among the clouds, they knew
just how to gauge distances, and in this way could
get the relative value of things. A novice would
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_90' id='Page_90'>90</a></span>
have found his calculations along these lines sadly at
variance with the facts.</p>

<p class='c009'>“For one,” said Billy, his voice showing signs of
trembling, “I won’t be sorry to hug up to a stove
when we get to our hangar once more. This air is
bitter up here, and seems to go right through you.
We’re in for a decent spell of weather, it strikes me,
Frank.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, it ought to last another day or so,” the other
replied, as though its condition was of importance.</p>

<p class='c009'>Indeed, when the wind blew the pilots were kept
from making their daily reconnoissance. During
storms and snow, or even rain, it was useless to take
the risks of venturing aloft, because the view would
be so limited, with the earth shrouded in fog or snow
squalls, that it would not pay to ascend.</p>

<p class='c009'>So it was that hundreds of daring aviators would
welcome this spell of quiet weather as an opportunity
that could not be allowed to slip past without
being taken advantage of.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ve passed over the trenches along the canal,”
announced Billy, still handling the glasses, and as
usual telling the busy pilot what he saw. “Now I can
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_91' id='Page_91'>91</a></span>
hear the British shouting hoarsely and they seem to
be waving all sorts of things up at us. Do you think
they know we are supposed to be trying out this seaplane
which was really contracted for by the French
Government before the war broke out?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They have guessed that we must be friendly to
their cause, because they saw something of what went
on back there when we struck that mine field,” Frank
explained without the least hesitation.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had been dropping lower the while, partly because
the air was so keen and cutting so many thousands
of feet up and also on account of the fact that
they had nothing more to fear from hostile demonstrations.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s the road to Dunkirk and Calais that the
Kaiser said his men would tramp along in time to be
in town at Christmas,” laughed Billy, pointing his
gloved hand downward to where could be seen various
detachments of marching troops, with scores of
huge motor vans taking supplies out along the fighting
line for the men who held the trenches, and the
bridge-heads across the river.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The British, with reinforcements coming up every
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_92' id='Page_92'>92</a></span>
day, seem to be holding all the ground around here,”
Frank was saying. “Can you see Dunkirk yet, Billy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! yes, easily enough. It isn’t such a great distance
away from where the fighting is taking place.
They’ve heard the roar of the big forty-two centimeter
German guns at Dunkirk more than once this
winter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Still lower they dropped, until at less than a thousand
feet they sailed along, now over the water, with
the Channel on their right, and the disputed shore
of France to the left.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you alight on the water, and then head
straight for our hangar, Frank?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is the easiest way to do it,” came the answer,
as though Frank had every detail mapped out in his
head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I warrant you Pudge is standing somewhere, and
watching us come along, with his heart beating furiously,
ready to fairly hug us after we get ashore.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Billy grinned as he thus pictured the delight of
their fat chum on hearing how magnificently the gallant
<em>Sea Eagle</em> had disported in the air high above
the German Headquarters, and what a spasm of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_93' id='Page_93'>93</a></span>
alarm their coming had sent to the hearts of the various
air pilots belonging to the invaders.</p>

<p class='c009'>With the grace of a monster swan, the seaplane
circled around several times and then alighted on the
bosom of the water, as softly as floating thistle down.
Equally at home in the air or on the water, the strange
hybrid craft immediately commenced to move along
in the direction of the wooden inclined plane leading
by a gradual rise from the water into the elevated
hangar.</p>

<p class='c009'>So ended the amazing and satisfactory trial trip of
the <em>Sea Eagle</em>.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_94' id='Page_94'>94</a></span>
  <h2 id='chIX' class='c010'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> <br />THRILLING NEWS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Mumps and mathematics, but I’m glad to see you
boys get back safe again!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Of course that was Pudge, otherwise Ulysses Perkins,
expressing his gratitude at the return of the
gallant <em>Sea Eagle</em> and the two bold air navigators.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pudge was close by on the shore when the seaplane
ran in to the foot of the wooden trestle, upon which
the big seaplane was drawn on the wheeled carriage,
built for that purpose, until it was once more
safely housed in the hangar.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t ask a single question, Pudge!” called Billy,
“until we’ve got her up the inclined plane, and snugly
sheltered from the public view. I guess there must
be a thousand people outside trying to see what the
<em>Sea Eagle</em> looks like. They must have watched us
coming on down the coast, and had a bad case of
fright at first, thinking it meant another spell of
bomb dropping.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_95' id='Page_95'>95</a></span>
“Yes, lend us a hand, Pudge,” added Frank, “and
help get the machine settled evenly on the little carriage.
You know we have it so arranged that she
can be hauled up by means of this cable, and by
her own motors. I’ll stay aboard to guide things,
and you two follow after we’re safely in the hangar,
not before.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Billy knew he meant a rope might possibly break,
and it would be dangerous for anyone to be caught
upon the trestle by the descending seaplane. Indeed,
Billy had a pretty vivid recollection of the narrow
escape of the two spies who had barely jumped aside
at the time of their downward rush.</p>

<p class='c009'>Everything went off without the slightest hitch,
and the first act of Pudge, after climbing the ascent
in company with Billy, was to hastily look over the
returned air traveler from the spoon-shaped bow to
the opposite extremity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Seems to be without a scratch, Frank!” he exclaimed
in undeniable glee.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, did you think we had been in some sort of
smash-up?” demanded Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, no, not quite so bad as that,” admitted
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_96' id='Page_96'>96</a></span>
Pudge; “but I knew some of those German spies
must have tried pretty hard to capture the craft, and
if that failed I reckoned they’d wanted to do something
to put her out of commission. Now, please,
sit down here and tell me everything.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ours is a long story, Pudge,” said Frank, “as you
can judge for yourself when I tell you we’ve been
far up over the fighting lines in Belgium, found ourselves
bombarded by shrapnel, and threatened by
half a dozen Taube flying machines, as well as a Zeppelin!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gosh! all of that?” gasped Pudge.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” added Billy, shaking his forefinger at the
stout chum, “and before we relate the whole story
in detail you’ve got to tell us what happened last
night that made you fail to come back when we expected
you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! I wanted to, all right,” spluttered Pudge, as
though he felt that somehow his bravery or his honor
might be involved in the explanation demanded; “but,
say, there were three of them, all big husky men, at
that, and they caught me unawares just by that turn
of the road. It was getting kind of dusk, too, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_97' id='Page_97'>97</a></span>
I never dreamed of trouble till one clapped a hand
over my mouth, and the others held me while they
tied a bandage around my face. Whee! I was near
smothered at first.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They were Germans, Pudge?” questioned Billy,
interested in the fact that Pudge had also had his
share of adventure.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I heard them talking in German, which made it
look that way,” replied the other soberly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They didn’t hurt you very much, did they?” asked
Billy, looking more closely at their jolly comrade.</p>

<p class='c009'>“More my feelings than anything else,” replied
Pudge, shrugging his fat shoulders disconsolately.
“They just kept me there while they waited to catch
some sort of signal. I listened, too, and heard some
shouting, but that cloth kept me from making out
what it meant. Afterward they set me free, and disappeared.
I didn’t know what to make of it when
I got to the hangar here and found the <em>Sea Eagle</em>
gone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You even felt afraid they had grabbed our seaplane,
didn’t you?” asked Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_98' id='Page_98'>98</a></span>
“Well, it gave me a bad scare at first,” Pudge admitted,
with charming frankness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you got over that later on, eh, Pudge?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I did when I heard you calling me from away
out somewhere in the dark,” explained the other.
“Were you on the water at that time, Frank, because
I figured you must be, with that old fog horn sound
coming stealing in to me out of that bank of gloom?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, that’s where we were, Pudge,” Frank told
him. “Now, since you’ve explained all about your
own doings, we’ll satisfy your curiosity by telling you
the particulars of the trial trip of our sample seaplane.
Billy, you can do the talking, if you feel equal to
it, while we start a fire here, and warm up with some
coffee.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A fire was soon sending out a fair amount of heat,
and the coffee pot placed upon the top of the little
sheet-iron stove gave promise of good cheer to come.
The aviator boys had enjoyed this social cup many
times while working on the assembling of the various
parts of the seaplane, so that they had all the necessary
accompaniments close by to be used after the
coffee had boiled.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_99' id='Page_99'>99</a></span>
Meanwhile Billy had been thrilling Pudge with a
recital of all he and Frank had gone through since
the fat chum left on his errand. He pictured the
dash down the trestle when the determined German
secret agents were trying to break in at the doors, so
as to seize and run off with the wonderful machine.
From that he went on to the adventure in the fog
and darkness of the night while they lay on the water
of the harbor, and the searching parties came upon
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then followed the early morning flight, what amazing
things they had seen when passing over the
trenches, the fierce bombardment to which they were
subjected, the maneuvers of the hostile aircraft, the
accident to the motors, and finally their triumphant
return to the hangar.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pudge drew a long breath when the story reached
its conclusion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And to think that I wasn’t along with you when
all those things happened; it’s enough to make anyone
weep,” he said, looking so downcast that Frank
felt it only right he should try and cheer the poor
fellow up.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_100' id='Page_100'>100</a></span>
“Never mind, Pudge,” he told him, “you were doing
your duty just as much as any of us. The fact that we
made that grand trip over the firing lines doesn’t
mean we have any more reason to crow than you do.
You can always say that you once had the great luck
to be actually taken prisoner by the Germans.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! they treated me all right, only that they kept
me a prisoner and wouldn’t parole me on my honor
not to betray them. Then, that cloth they tied around
my face must have been something they picked up,
for it seemed like an old rag. But thank goodness
it’s all over with now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” said Billy lightly, “no use ever borrowing
trouble about things that are dead and gone. You
know they say the mill will never run again with
the water that is past. But there’s someone at the
door, Frank.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I imagine it must be our friend, Major Nixon,”
said Frank. “He’s heard that we’ve been away on
some sort of trial spin to test things, and has dropped
around to learn how we made out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’s going to be surprised a whole lot when he
hears all we’ve got to tell,” said Billy, with a chuckle,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_101' id='Page_101'>101</a></span>
as he started over to unfasten the door, upon the
panel of which those knocks had been sounded.</p>

<p class='c009'>It proved that Frank was a good prophet, for the
visitor was the red-faced British officer connected
with the aviation squad at Dunkirk. His manner
betrayed the fact that he had come either to fetch
some important news or else to be told something
along those lines.</p>

<p class='c009'>Once again did Billy have to start in. Fortunately,
he was a pretty fair story-teller, and enthusiasm with
his subject did more or less to help him. The Major
was duly thrilled with the graphic account of all the
stirring events that had come to Frank and Billy since
the afternoon.</p>

<p class='c009'>Being a man of considerable experience in aviation,
though no longer allowed to make an ascent, on account
of being subject to dizzy spells, the after effects
from a severe accident, Major Nixon at least
could enjoy hearing about the exploits of others.</p>

<p class='c009'>Billy, too, was blunt, and not at all inclined to make
himself and chum out to be any sort of heroes. He
told the story in a most matter-of-fact way, though
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_102' id='Page_102'>102</a></span>
reading between the lines the officer was able to picture
things about as they happened.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m pleased to hear your grand account of this
great seaplane,” he told them when Billy at last told
of their safe return to the waiting hangar. “My
word, if only we British had fifty like it, I believe
we would be in condition to end the war before three
months had passed. No Zeppelin would dare enter
into the same class. What magnificent craft they
would be for protecting the home coast from such
bombardments as happened not so very long ago.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” said Frank, thinking to strike while the
iron was hot, “we’re going to ask that from now on
our hangar be guarded against any sort of attack.
This seaplane, after certain formalities have been complied
with, really will belong to the French Government;
so it’s surely up to you to defend the property
of your ally from a raid.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your point is well taken, Frank,” the officer told
him. “Every hour of the day and night I will see
to it that a company of armed guards is stationed
around your property, with instructions to defend it
against any force of thieves, desperate spies or any
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_103' id='Page_103'>103</a></span>
other invaders. They will rue the hour they attempt
to capture or injure your wonderful seaplane.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Major Nixon always made it a point to walk around
the big air rover, and carefully note its various strong
points as developed through the patents of its inventor,
Dr. Perkins, U. S. A. He was the only one
who had thus far been given the privilege of seeing
the odd machine at close quarters; because the boys
had the utmost confidence in his honor as a soldier
and a gentleman.</p>

<p class='c009'>It seemed to Billy that the Major spent an unusually
long time looking things over on this occasion.
Perhaps he wished to verify the statements,
to which he had just listened, concerning the stability
of the seaplane and its condition for hard service.</p>

<p class='c009'>When he joined them again, Billy also noticed
that there was a most peculiar expression on the
other’s red face, of which he could make nothing at
the time, although it all came to him afterward.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is the seaplane in condition for another trip that
might cover several times the distance you did in this
trial spin?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>Billy thought this to be merely a casual question,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_104' id='Page_104'>104</a></span>
such as anyone might ask after hearing the story just
finished; but Frank, able to see further, believed there
might be a meaning behind it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All I would have to do would be to replace the
liquid fuel that we have used, and after oiling the
bearings in a few places, I give you my word, Major
Nixon, I would be willing to take the chances of going
to Paris and back in the <em>Sea Eagle</em> with as many
as two or more companions on the journey.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Upon hearing that the other smiled as though the
answer pleased him. There were numerous attributes
connected with Frank Chester calculated to appeal to
a man of his observation; and considering the fact
that he was an Englishman, usually cold and reserved
toward outsiders, the Major had become warmly attached
to the boy aviators and their fortunes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now, if you’ll bend your heads toward me,
because sometimes the very walls have ears, they say,”
he remarked impressively, “I’ll tell you a great secret.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Realizing that this was no joke, Frank, Billy and
even Pudge leaned forward, after which Major
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_105' id='Page_105'>105</a></span>
Nixon went on to say in a cautious tone hardly more
than a whisper:</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was learned that our friends, the enemy, intended
sending out another one of their exasperating
raids with half a dozen Taubes. They would drop
a few bombs on Dunkirk and Calais and call that a
great feat. Now more than <em>thirty seaplanes</em>, guided
by some of the most daring of British aviators, plan
a gigantic raid on the German sea bases in Belgium
to-night, <em>and you can accompany them if you will</em>!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_106' id='Page_106'>106</a></span>
  <h2 id='chX' class='c010'>CHAPTER X.<br /> <br />THE AËROPLANE BOYS IN LUCK.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Thrilled by the nature of the communication made
by the British officer, Frank, Billy and Pudge stood
there staring at one another.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of course it was not so very difficult for Frank
to understand just why this invitation to accompany
the raiding party of British aviators had come to them.
Back of it all was the French Government, he felt
certain. Before going into the business of making
heavy investments connected with the new American
seaplane patents it was only natural they should desire
to witness an efficient test of the machine’s superiority
over any aëroplanes they already possessed.</p>

<p class='c009'>The contemplated raid would afford such a test.
Competent critics, those other experienced birdmen,
would be near to gauge the capacity of the <em>Sea Eagle</em>.
In other words, the French Government did not want
to “buy a pig in the poke.” Unless the hybrid sea
and aircraft could meet the requirements laid down,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_107' id='Page_107'>107</a></span>
they would not dare risk squandering great amounts
of money in those hard times to duplicate her model.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank was greatly pleased. It seemed as though
he and his chums had received a magnificent compliment
in being honored with such an invitation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course, Major Nixon, you have been authorized
to see us, and extend this courtesy?” he asked,
as a starter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can show you my credentials in that line, Frank,”
the genial officer replied, without the least hesitation
or embarrassment, which he accordingly proceeded to
do, thus relieving the other’s mind in the beginning.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Everything is shipshape, sir,” said Frank. “Now
let us talk about the conditions under which we are
to be allowed to accompany the expedition”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Please keep your voice lowered as much as you
can while I instruct you,” begged Major Nixon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are thinking of those German spies who are
said to be everywhere?” ventured Frank, who had
heard much talk along these lines ever since arriving
at Dunkirk.</p>

<p class='c009'>Indeed, the stories that passed current concerning
spies were astonishing. Most of them Frank did not
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_108' id='Page_108'>108</a></span>
believe in at all, for he knew they were founded on
the fears of the people. At the same time the secret
agents of the Kaiser were certainly vigilant as well as
bold, and if one had to err at all it were better to be
on the safe side.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In times past I haven’t taken much stock in the
wild stories that have been going around,” said the
soldier, smiling; “but we certainly know there are
spies in Dunkirk at this very hour. In fact, you boys
have had pretty strong evidence that your operations
while here have been watched day by day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” remarked Billy, “and after what happened
last night we are ready to believe almost anything,
sir. I remember reading that sometimes the walls
have ears, and I guess it may be so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Under such conditions then it is best that we get
our heads close together and talk in very low tones,”
said the officer. “There are guards posted all around
the stockade now, and yet in spite of that precaution
some of those German spies are smart enough to play
the game.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Anchors and aëroplanes, but this is exciting
enough to please even a fellow built like you are,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_109' id='Page_109'>109</a></span>
Billy!” muttered Pudge, who was mopping his red
forehead with his handkerchief, though the others
did not consider it any too warm there in the hangar
of the great seaplane.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am unable to tell you at this minute the exact
hour when the start will be made,” Major Nixon
whispered. “Much depends on the state of the
weather, and the arrival of the fleet of aëroplanes
from across the Channel, for most of them will come
from England, you understand.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Conditions being favorable, then,” observed
Frank, “you believe that by another morning the start
of the raiding party will take place?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, undoubtedly,” came the answer. “We wish
to take advantage of the unusually good weather conditions.
Then, besides, we have learned through certain
sources of information that the Germans on their
own hook are planning an extensive dash with their
aëroplanes and dirigibles on the coast cities on the
Channel. It is in hopes of balking that, as well as
accomplishing other results that more than thirty seaplanes
will make this stupendous raid on their
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_110' id='Page_110'>110</a></span>
submarine bases at Ostend, Zeebrugge and Blankenberghe.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sandwiches and sauerkraut!” Pudge was heard to
gasp, as though his breath were almost taken away by
the magnitude of this assertion; for he had never as
yet seen as many as thirty aëroplanes assembled together,
and certainly not in action.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is that the only motive of the raid, Major Nixon?”
Frank asked, for he invariably made it a point to acquire
all the information possible.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” continued the soldier, “to be perfectly frank
with you, there are a number of other objects which
such a sudden attack is likely to influence. It is aimed
to destroy the railway station at Ostend so as to
greatly hinder the movement of troop trains and
those carrying ammunition and supplies. Then, at
Bruges, other damage may be done.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But isn’t there still another big object in it?” insisted
Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose you are referring to the great submarine
blockade of the coasts of Great Britain which
Germany proposes to inaugurate next week?” said
Major Nixon. “Yes, although I have not been so
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_111' id='Page_111'>111</a></span>
informed, I can guess readily enough that by means
of this raid it is hoped to extensively damage their
submarine base at Zeebrugge, and injure the movement
in the beginning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In other words,” said Frank, “Great Britain
means to throw down the gage of battle, and warn
Germany she can make just as dashing raids as anyone.
No one nation is mistress of the air in this
world war—as yet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Major Nixon smiled as he heard those last two
words, and saw the quick look of pride which the
young aviator threw toward the monster seaplane that
was housed in that hangar.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s plain that you have the utmost confidence in
the ability of your machine to wrest that supremacy
from the Germans, if once France secures the right
to manufacture a fleet of <em>Sea Eagles</em>,” he remarked,
as he laid a hand upon the shoulder of Frank Chester,
of whom the bluff soldier had become quite fond in
the short time they had known each other.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then it is understood, Major, that we keep ourselves
in readiness to start out so as to be on the
move at dawn, for I don’t imagine such a great fleet
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_112' id='Page_112'>112</a></span>
of aëroplanes would wish to make a start in the darkness
of night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, there is no necessity of such a thing,” came
the quick reply. “In fact, one of the objects of this
raid is publicity. We do not aim to creep up and
damage the enemy in the dark. We want him to see
the astonishing sight of such a mass of darting seaplanes
descending on his coast towns like a flock of
eagles, and destroying military property, not citizens’
private homes, mind you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think,” said Frank, “I can speak for my friends
here as well as myself, Major, when I promise to be
ready for the signal. How will we know when to
start out, for we shall all sleep here to-night?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is only one condition which you will be
asked to meet,” said the other.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then tell us what it is, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The French Government will expect to have a representative
aboard the <em>Sea Eagle</em> during the flight,
not to interfere in the slightest degree with your mastery
of the seaplane, but simply to take notes concerning
her behavior under every sort of condition.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We certainly agree to that condition, Major
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_113' id='Page_113'>113</a></span>
Nixon,” said Frank heartily. “In fact, I should have
asked that one be sent out with us. It is a part of
our policy to fully satisfy the authorities we’ve been
dealing with for nearly a year, now, that everything
we claim, and much more, is possible with our advanced
model of a hydro-aëroplane.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very good, and I am pleased to know it,” said
the officer. “I shall have to go back to town, now,
but I will advise the local representative of the Government
that you accept the conditions. By early
dawn there will appear here a skillful aviator with
written credentials, and I hope his ultimate report will
be all you boys hoped it to be. My word! I only
wish I were going with you, but other duties must
claim my attention.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He shook each one of them warmly by the hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The best of luck, Frank,” were his last words at
parting. “I trust that you may have an experience
calculated to dwarf anything that has ever come your
way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank, as he contemplated what a thrilling adventure
lay before them, fancied that this wish on the
part of Major Nixon was in a fair way of coming
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_114' id='Page_114'>114</a></span>
true. It certainly would be difficult to imagine a more
exciting experience than taking part in an aërial raid,
where more than thirty seaplanes started out to bombard
strongly fortified coast defenses of the enemy,
each raider subjected to a continual fire from every
known species of anti-aircraft gun known to modern
warfare.</p>

<p class='c009'>After the soldier had left them, the three Boy Aviators
sat around and talked in low tones. They had
barred the door, and so far as they could see there
was not the slightest chance that any eavesdropper
could get close enough to overhear what they said.
Nevertheless, the caution of Major Nixon had its effect
upon them and there was no loud conversation
except when ordinary matters were touched upon.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank always liked to “potter” around and give
little touches of improvement to some part of the
seaplane in which he had such a deep interest. No
one knew its good and bad qualities as well as Frank;
even its inventor had not studied these points as carefully
as the young aviator.</p>

<p class='c009'>So it happened that from time to time the boy made
numerous little improvements that he figured would
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_115' id='Page_115'>115</a></span>
cause the motors to work more smoothly, or
strengthen some part of the framework that showed
signs of weakness.</p>

<p class='c009'>Half a dozen times Frank left his two chums, sitting
there killing time, to attend to something connected
with the plane. He had carefully examined to
find what had caused the accident that gave them such
a thrill when thousands of feet above the earth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The same thing will never occur again, that I’m
as sure of as I am of my own name,” he told Billy,
when the other asked him about it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Several hours had passed since the soldier had
left them. Pudge, having taken a stroll outside, came
back to report that there were at least a dozen British
“Tommies” standing guard around the enclosure
in which the hangar had been erected.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s a good thing, too,” said Pudge, “because a
crowd has come out from town to hang around here
in hopes we’ll make a flight to-day. Oilskins and
onions, but I should think there must be a hundred
people if there’s one. But those Tommies are ready
to use their bayonets on the first fellow who tried
to climb up and peep over the stockade.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_116' id='Page_116'>116</a></span>
“There are two guards, I noticed, down by the end
of the trestle, where it strikes the water,” observed
Billy, who had been moving around.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank was doing some little job under the seaplane,
and at this moment came sauntering toward his two
mates. Billy, happening to glance up at the other’s
face was surprised to see that Frank looked excited;
at least his eyes sparkled strangely, and there was a
grimness in the way he had set his jaws.</p>

<p class='c009'>Billy, always inclined to be explosive, might have
burst out with a question only that he received a quick
and expressive look from Frank, accompanied by the
placing of a finger on his lips. Then, as Frank
dropped into a chair beside them, Billy leaned over
to whisper:</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s up now, Frank, that you’re looking so
mysterious?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve just made a discovery, that’s all,” came the
same sort of careful reply. “Fact is, after all our precautions
we’ve been outwitted, for there’s a spy hidden
in the hangar right now!”</p>

  <h2 id='chXI' class='c010'>CHAPTER XI.<br /> <br />THE MAN IN THE LOCKER.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Are you joking, Frank?” asked Billy, though he
should have known his comrade better than to believe
Frank would try to play any silly trick for the
sake of giving them a thrill.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pudge opened his mouth, but for a wonder even one
of his queer favorite expressions failed to drop from
his lips. In fact, Pudge was rendered temporarily
speechless by the astounding nature of Frank’s communication.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not at all, Billy,” said the other, trying to act as
though he might be telling them something of small
importance. “I watched while I was sheltered under
the plane, and twice I saw it shake a little as though
some one might be holding the door ajar so as to
hear better.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Door!” echoed Billy helplessly, as though more
puzzled than ever.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The door of the empty locker we thought we
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_118' id='Page_118'>118</a></span>
might need for storing things away, but which has
never been used,” Frank explained.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gee whillikins! now I understand what you mean,
Frank,” said Billy. “There is plenty of room in that
locker to hold a man curled up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Popguns and pyramids, but how could he ever
get there when we’ve been sitting around all morning?”
asked Pudge, in a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Only in one way,” Frank told him. “Before they
left here last night they must have fixed him there
in the locker, believing we’d be back again sooner or
later, when some information of value might be
picked up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! my stars, Frank,” Billy ejaculated huskily.
“What if, after all, he’s heard enough talk here to
guess about that big raid?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank looked very serious.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s true that we’ve been pretty careful,” he said,
“and most of the time just whispered while we talked
about it; but all the same a man with the ears of a
spy might have picked up enough to arouse suspicions,
and once that’s done the rest would come easy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What can we do about it, Frank?” asked Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_119' id='Page_119'>119</a></span>
“Our good friend, the Major, has extended the invitation
to us so that in a way I feel we’re responsible
for the secret being kept,” Frank went on to say, as
though he might be revolving certain conditions in his
mind before deciding.</p>

<p class='c009'>On hearing him say that Billy began to work the
muscles of his right arm, at the same time opening
and closing his fingers, as though eager to clutch
something.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I agree with you, Frank,” he hastened to say.
“The great secret has been placed in our keeping, and
for one I would feel pretty small if it leaked out
through any fault of ours. We’ve got to cage that
spy as sure as you live.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Punkins and partridges, that’s right!” muttered
Pudge, who, while not as a rule pugnaciously inclined,
could nevertheless assume what he was pleased
to call his “fighting face” when occasion arose.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m glad to find both of you are of the same
mind,” Frank said. “The only question is to decide
what our plan of campaign shall be.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“P’r’aps some of those Tommies in khaki would
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_120' id='Page_120'>120</a></span>
be only too glad of a chance to step in and collar the
spy?” suggested Pudge.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But there are three of us here,” objected Billy,
“and I don’t see why we should want to call on the
soldiers for such a little thing. After we’ve grabbed
Mr. Spy and have got him tied up it will be time
enough to figure on handing him over to the authorities.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s what’s worrying me,” admitted Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“About handing him over, do you mean?” Billy demanded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, you know what the fate of a spy always is,”
the other said. “We are supposed to be neutral in
this war business. No matter whether our sympathy
lies with Belgium, Germany, or France, we’ve got to
try and treat them as much alike as we can. Our
company has been negotiating with the French Government
for a long time, now, over this contract, and
so, of course, we have to favor them if anybody; but
boys, not one of us would like to feel that we were
the cause of a spy being shot or hanged.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh well, we could kick him off the place after we
got him out, Frank,” suggested Pudge so aggressively
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_121' id='Page_121'>121</a></span>
that Billy chuckled, and started to smooth the fat
chum down the back, just as one might a pugnacious
rooster who was boiling with a desire to plunge into
carnage.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That sounds all right,” Frank told him; “but you
forget the one important thing. He has some knowledge
of this raid, and if we let him go it may mean
a great disaster to the fleet of seaplanes taking part
in the dash up the coast.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whew! looks like we might be what my father
would say was between the upper and the nether millstones,”
remarked Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gatling guns and grasshoppers,” Pudge added,
“my father would go further than that, I guess, and
say we were between the devil and the deep sea. But
Frank, you’re the one to decide that question. What
shall we do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is a way,” Frank announced, “by which we
could settle it so the man wouldn’t fall into the hands
of the military authorities, who would execute him,
and at the same time he could be kept from betraying
what he may have learned.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Glad to hear it,” said Pudge; “because I don’t
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_122' id='Page_122'>122</a></span>
want to know I’ve been instrumental in standing a
poor fellow up before a file, and getting him filled with
cold lead. Tell us about it, please, Frank.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“After we’ve captured the man we’ll get word to
the civil authorities, saying we’ve caught a thief in
our hangar, and asking them to keep him safe for
two or three days. I’ll go and see the Major myself,
and get him to promise that the man will be treated
only as a thief and not as a spy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ve guessed the answer, Frank,” announced
Pudge, with the enthusiasm he always showed when
the leader of the aviator boys blazed a trail out of
some wilderness in which they had lost themselves.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then the sooner we get busy the better,” hinted
Billy, again working that good right arm of his as
though it might be rapidly getting beyond his restraint.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We have no firearms, though,” suggested Pudge.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s no need of any,” Frank told him. “I’ll
hold this wrench in a way that’ll make it seem like a
six-shooter. The rest of you can help pile on the
man when we drag him out of the locker, either feet
or head first, it doesn’t matter which.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_123' id='Page_123'>123</a></span>
“Just give me a chance to sit on him, that’s all!”
threatened Pudge, at which Billy could be heard to
chuckle, as though he pitied anyone who went through
that far from enviable experience; perhaps Billy knew
from his own associations with Pudge what such an
operation meant.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, here’s the way we’ll fix it,” began Frank.
“I’ll step over again to the other side of the hangar
to work at the motors of the <em>Sea Eagle</em>. Pretty soon
you’ll hear me calling to you both to come around and
see what a clever little arrangement I’ve fixed up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Which will, in other words, mean the fun is about
to begin?” commented Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When you join me,” continued Frank, “we’ll jabber
for a minute, during which I’ll say we might as
well go to town and get something decent to eat at
noon. That will be apt to put him off his guard.
Then we’ll all tiptoe over to the locker, and at a signal
throw the door open. As soon as you glimpse him,
take hold, and start to pulling like a house afire.
That will keep him from trying to fight back or use
his weapon, for I guess he’ll have a gun of some kind.
Understand it all, boys?”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_124' id='Page_124'>124</a></span>
“Go on, Frank. Please don’t wait any longer than
you have to,” pleaded Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>So Frank, a minute or two later, called to them to
come and see what a splendid little change he had
made in the gear of the deflecting rudder of the big
seaplane.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a thrilling moment for the three boys when
they began to move in the direction of the locker
where Frank believed a spy had taken refuge many
hours previously. As he had suggested, they walked
on their tiptoes, each fastening his eager gaze upon
the door which they expected to presently pull suddenly
open.</p>

<p class='c009'>When they had taken up their positions according
to Frank’s plan, he gave the expected signal.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, everybody!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The locker door was dragged open in spite of the
fact that something seemed to be clinging desperately
to it from the inside. No sooner had this been accomplished
than the boys, stooping, seized hold of
the doubled-up figure they could see in the cavity
under the bench, and started to drag with might and
main.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic003'>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_125' id='Page_125'>125</a></span>
Although the man in hiding made a powerful effort
to resist the pressure brought to bear upon him, he
was hardly in a position to do much.</p>

<p class='c009'>They dragged him out, squirming like a rat taken
by the tail, and trying to hold on to every object,
however small, as a drowning man will catch at a
straw. No sooner was he in full view than Pudge
dropped down on his back with all his force.</p>

<p class='c009'>A dismal groan announced that the breath had
been pretty well driven from the spy’s lungs; and before
he could recover his wits enough to try and produce
any weapon Frank clapped the end of his wrench
against his temple while he called out in very commanding
tones:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t try to draw a gun or you are a dead man!
I’ve got you covered, and will pull the trigger if you
so much as move a hand!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Having in this manner caused the prisoner to behave,
Frank hastily searched his pockets and confiscated
a stubby little revolver which he found there.
Then he told Billy to tie the man’s wrists together,
placing them behind his back, with a stout piece of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_126' id='Page_126'>126</a></span>
tarred rope that lay within convenient reaching distance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now he’s helpless, and we can let him get to his
feet if we want,” said Billy; but Frank thought otherwise.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s better to be on the safe side,” he observed.
“So use the balance of the rope around his ankles,
Billy. I want to leave you two here while I go to
town and make arrangements through Major Nixon
to have the man held simply as a thief and not as a
spy. I’d like to know he couldn’t get away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They found that he was rather a small man, with
a cunning face. He did not look very much like a
German, and possibly had been picked out for his
hazardous pursuit on that very account.</p>

<p class='c009'>To their surprise he addressed them in the best of
English.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am an American citizen, you must know, and I
have the papers to prove it. My name is Hans Larsen
and I came from Sweden many years ago.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! is that so?” remarked Frank, who had lately
read that many Germans across the sea had been able
to secure the naturalization papers belonging to others
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_127' id='Page_127'>127</a></span>
in order to cross to Sweden or Italy without being
taken prisoner by the English naval men, and Frank
rightly guessed the spy had fortified himself in that
way so as to have some means for escaping death in
case of capture.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then what were you doing hidden in that locker?”
demanded Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have no money, and I was hungry,” said the man.
“I came here to pick up something I could sell for
a few sous, and get some bread. Then I heard voices
and afraid to be seen I crawled under there. Let me
go and I shall never bother you again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Billy laughed in his face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They say a lame excuse is better than none,” he
remarked, “but when Frank pulled that fierce-looking
gun out of your pocket I saw a bright coin fall to the
floor. Here it is, and a gold coin in the bargain. An
English sovereign at that. I wonder why anyone
should go hungry long in Dunkirk these days with all
that money in his pocket? Don’t try to trick us, my
man. We know why you were hidden in that locker,
and you don’t need to be told what a spy can expect
when caught in the act.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_128' id='Page_128'>128</a></span>
The man shut his teeth hard together, and gave a
little groan, but said nothing. He evidently expected
that the fate he may have dared so often had at last
found him out.</p>

  <h2 id='chXII' class='c010'>CHAPTER XII.<br /> <br />FRANK MAKES A BARGAIN.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“What’s the next thing on the program, Frank?”
asked Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I must go to town and see Major Nixon,” came
the prompt reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You mean so as to hand this prisoner over to his
charge, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I want to get in touch with the civil authorities,
and make certain arrangements looking to his detention
for several days,” explained Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>The spy started and looked eagerly at the speaker.
His dry lips moved as though he were trying to voice
the sudden hope that had flashed through his brain;
but no sound followed. Still it could be seen that his
despair was not as complete as before.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But Frank,” interrupted Pudge, “perhaps it won’t
be necessary for you to skip out and leave.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell me what you mean, Pudge?” Frank asked
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_130' id='Page_130'>130</a></span>
“Use the telephone, and talk with the Major. Yes,
it was knocked out of commission by those smarties,
but while you were away this morning, having nothing
else to do, I amused myself hunting for the break
in the wire, which I found and easily spliced.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Does it work all right now, Pudge?” questioned
Billy, grinning at the thought of the other doing all
that climbing, because action of this sort was hardly
the forte of their stout chum.</p>

<p class='c009'>“As good as ever, for I tested it,” he was told.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank, however, shook his head in the negative.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think I had better go personally and see the
Major,” he told them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How’s that, Frank?” remarked Billy quickly. “Do
you suspect that in some way those men may have
tapped our wire?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I wouldn’t put it past them,” came the reply.
“Spies have to be up to all sorts of clever dodges,
and that would be just in line with their work.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Billy gave a whistle to indicate the state of his
mixed feelings.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gee whillikins, to think that we haven’t whispered
a single sentence along that wire but what some
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_131' id='Page_131'>131</a></span>
outsider was drinking it in! Frank, I guess you’re right,
and that in a particular case like this it’s best to deal
at first hand with Major Nixon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m sure of that, boys,” the leader told them in
his quiet, convincing way.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And I suppose that you want us to stick by the
hangar while you’re away; is that the game, Frank?”
Pudge wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, and be mighty careful how you take your
eyes off the prisoner for even a minute,” Frank directed.
“I’m going to look all around the place before
I leave, so as to make sure there isn’t another
spy hidden away in some corner. As soon as I step
out, fasten the door and keep it so. I may call you
up over the wire, and if I do you’ll know my voice.
Besides, to make absolutely sure I’ll give you our old
signal. That’s about all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He bustled around for several minutes, and thoroughly
explored the whole interior of the hangar.
When Frank had finished his task he was absolutely
sure that no intruder larger than a mouse could have
escaped his search.</p>

<p class='c009'>Once outside he made for the gate, where he found
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_132' id='Page_132'>132</a></span>
a couple of rosy-cheeked British khaki-clad Tommies
on guard, with whom he exchanged pleasant greetings.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t let a single soul get past here until I come
back again,” he told them. “I’m going to see Major
Nixon, who is a personal friend of mine, and my
business with him is very important. We’ve caught
a—well, a thief in the hangar, and I want him to take
charge of the rascal. If you hear any row in there
while I’m gone have some of your men go up to the
door; but keep the gate guarded meanwhile.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The two soldiers promised that they would attend
strictly to business. They knew something of what
these young American boys were doing over in France,
and that their presence had to do with the closing of
certain arrangements with the French Government
that had been under way before the breaking out of
the war.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank walked off.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was feeling very well satisfied with the way
things were coming out. It was true there might be
some cause for uneasiness in connection with the determined
efforts of the spies to either steal or ruin
the machine; but Frank believed he and his chums,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_133' id='Page_133'>133</a></span>
assisted by the Allies, could keep it from being destroyed
through a bomb placed under the hangar by
a secret agent of the Kaiser.</p>

<p class='c009'>One could not go very far in the neighborhood of
Dunkirk in those stirring days without being visibly
reminded that it was a time of war. Soldiers in detachments
were moving this way or that; tents could
be seen in the fields; artillery was passing along the
heavy roads bound for the front, where the British
army in the low country along the Yser Canal must
be getting ready for that long-heralded drive that
was to usher in the new policy of aggression in the
early Spring.</p>

<p class='c009'>Everywhere he looked Frank could see signs of
this feverish life. How different things were across
the ocean in his own beloved land; and how thankful
he was that peace lay upon the great country of
which he was a son.</p>

<p class='c009'>He knew where he was likely to find Major Nixon,
for he had been to see him at his quarters before now.
As he walked quickly along with a springy step, Frank
was laying out his plan of campaign. It was like
him to prepare for possibilities, because he was
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_134' id='Page_134'>134</a></span>
determined that, as far as he could prevent it, he and
his chums would not take sides in this terrible struggle
for supremacy, any more than could be prevented.</p>

<p class='c009'>Coming to the building in which the British had
their Headquarters he was stopped by a sentry who
demanded his business.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I must see Major Nixon on very important business,”
Frank told him. “I hope he is in his quarters,
for I wish to send my card with a line on it to
him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Of course all that the sentry could do was to summon
a noncommissioned officer, to whom Frank repeated
his request. It happened that the sergeant
had seen Frank walking arm in arm with the Major,
and hence knew that they were friends.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He is very busy just now, and gave word that he
was not to be disturbed except on most important
business,” the sergeant informed him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is a matter,” the boy told him impressively,
“that concerns grave issues connected with the plans
of your leaders, and I hope you will see that the Major
gets my card.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will carry it to him myself,” announced the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_135' id='Page_135'>135</a></span>
sergeant, which he accordingly did, and soon came back
nodding his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>The few urgent words written on the card had the
desired effect, for the sergeant immediately asked
Frank to follow him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Major Nixon told me to say that he would see
you, sir,” was the message he gave the boy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently Frank entered the soldier’s room. He
found the Major impatiently awaiting his coming, and
with an extended hand in the bargain.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My word! but you’ve given me a beastly shock by
what you write,” he was saying as he shook hands.
“‘Plans threatened with disaster—must see you at
once!’ Now be good enough to tell me what it all
means, for I’m shivering with dread. If anything
happened to upset all those splendidly arranged plans
for the raid, we’d be broken-hearted, you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Before I say a single word, Major Nixon, I want
you to give me your promise to agree to a certain
stipulation I shall make. It simply concerns a man’s
life; and will not interfere the least bit with your
ideas of military rules.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s a singular request to make, Frank, but I
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_136' id='Page_136'>136</a></span>
think I know you well enough to feel sure you will
not bind me to anything that would touch upon my
honor. I promise you then that you shall have your
way; for I imagine you want to have the disposal of
this unknown man in your own hands.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is just what I want, Major,” returned the
other quickly. “And now listen while I tell you of
a remarkable thing that happened after you left us
this morning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“At your hangar, do you mean?” asked the soldier,
looking startled.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope you don’t intend to tell me any of our men
have proven false to their trust and betrayed you,
Frank; because I happen to know that the aviator
corps expects great things of that invention of Dr.
Perkins’, should it eventually become the property
of the French Government.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There has been no traitor in the camp, Major,”
the other hastened to assure him. “But nevertheless
we have learned that all the while you were there talking
to us, and while we have been discussing the intended
raid in low tones among ourselves, there was
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_137' id='Page_137'>137</a></span>
a spy concealed in the hangar who must have heard
more or less of what was said, despite our precautions.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The soldier jumped to his feet. He looked almost
frightened as he stared into the face of Frank Chester.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are sure of what you say, are you, Frank?”
he asked with an effort.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! there isn’t the slightest doubt about it,” came
the reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Major Nixon began to breathe easier. He
saw that Frank was smiling, and his common sense
told him the boy would not be likely to show such
freedom from anxiety if things were as bad as he
had at first feared.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Frank, tell me the rest without delay. I know
you’ve got good news back of this astonishing disclosure.
Where is that spy now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In the hangar still,” replied Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you take him prisoner?” demanded the Major
eagerly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, and I’ll tell you how it was done, sir. We
had quite a little circus for a short time, believe me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Major Nixon listened, and as he heard how Pudge
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_138' id='Page_138'>138</a></span>
sat down upon the surprised eavesdropper whom they
had dragged from the locker, he even smiled, for that
terrible fear had by now left his soul.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My word! what great luck that you caught him
before he could send any sort of signal to his companions!”
he exclaimed. “And we must see to it
that he does not have a chance to even wink an eye
toward anyone. It would have ruined everything if
he had slipped away. I am a thousand times obliged
to you, Frank, for being so much on the alert. It
would have ruined my own career if the break had
been traced back and placed on my shoulders. We
will see to it that this spy gets all that is coming to
him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! but you forget your promise, Major Nixon!”
remarked the boy coolly.</p>

<p class='c009'>The soldier looked at him and frowned.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But Frank, a spy is a dangerous sort of reptile,
no matter on which side he is working,” he objected.
“These Germans have the most complete system of
secret espionage ever known. It is hard to keep anything
from their knowledge. This man knew the risk
when he hid there in your hangar. He should pay
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_139' id='Page_139'>139</a></span>
the penalty of his venture. He can expect nothing
less than death.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wait, Major Nixon; please remember that he is
<em>my</em> prisoner, not yours. If I had spoken the word
he could have been set free. You gave me your
solemn promise that I should have the say of his
fate if I handed him over to the authorities.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The soldier pondered these words for a minute
before continuing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell me just what you’ve got in your mind, my
boy,” he said, “and I feel certain that I can agree
to it, because I know how sensible you are.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then listen, sir,” said Frank impressively. “We
three are Americans, and while we may sympathize
with the Allies in this struggle at the same time we do
not hate the German people, but feel the warmest
friendship for them. We would not care to remember
that we had turned over this spy to the military authorities
to be shot. It would grieve us more than I
can tell you, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you have a plan, Frank, of course?” ventured
the other.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_140' id='Page_140'>140</a></span>
“Which, it is to be hoped, will protect our great secret?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here is what I want you to agree to, sir,” Frank
told him. “We will turn this man over to the civil
authorities of Dunkirk to be considered solely in the
light of a sneak thief who meant to steal something
from our hangar and dispose of it so as to buy food.
He has papers to show that he is by birth a Swede,
but an American citizen by adoption.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! yes, but those have undoubtedly been stolen,
and are being used for a purpose anyone can understand,”
declared the soldier.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, that is what we believed, sir,” said Frank.
“At the same time if he were shot it might raise an
unpleasant tension between my Government and the
Allies. As I look at it, the main thing you want to
do is to so arrange it that this spy can in no manner
communicate with any of his fellows. Am I right
there, Major?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, yes; that is the principal thing we must consider
now, Frank.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right, that can be done just as well if he is
shut up as a thief, and at the end of three days, after
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_141' id='Page_141'>141</a></span>
the raid is a thing of the past, allowed to take his departure
from Dunkirk with a warning that if caught
again he will pay the penalty with his life.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Again the soldier pondered. He did not like to
let the spy off so easily, for like most bluff fighting
men, Major Nixon felt an aversion for those clever
secret agents who could block the plans of generals
through securing information in advance.</p>

<p class='c009'>Finally he gave a sigh and smiled at Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My word! but you know how to handle matters,
Frank,” he observed. “Of course I can see just how
you and your fine chums must feel about this thing;
and on the whole I do not blame you. Yes, I give
you my promise again that it will be done as you say.
We will take the man to a place of security where he
cannot find a chance to communicate with his kind in
any possible way. He will be known simply as a suspected
thief on the records. And after the raid is
over with, I myself will see that he is led to the outskirts
of the town, and let go with a warning. Is
that sufficient, Frank?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sir, for I know your word is as good as your
bond,” Frank told him. “I feel I have done my duty
without being instrumental in sacrificing a life.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_142' id='Page_142'>142</a></span>
  <h2 id='chXIII' class='c010'>CHAPTER XIII.<br /> <br />NOT CAUGHT NAPPING.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Frank was perfectly satisfied with the promise
given him by Major Nixon. He knew the bluff British
soldier would keep his word to the letter. While
the man who had been caught hiding in the hangar
of the young American aviators would be taken to a
place of security and kept carefully guarded, in order
to prevent his knowledge concerning the contemplated
aërial raid from leaking out, at the same time his life
would not pay the penalty of his capture.</p>

<p class='c009'>After some more conversation covering the matter
Frank, knowing the other to be very busy, took his
leave.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A last word of warning, my boy,” said the soldier,
after shaking hands. “Keep on the alert wherever
you go in Dunkirk. While the place itself is
loyal, and is thronged now with soldiers of every
type, at the same time we know there are many secret
sympathizers with the other side here trying to learn
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_143' id='Page_143'>143</a></span>
the plans of our generals, so that they can communicate
them to the Kaiser’s leaders.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But why should I be picked out for trouble?”
asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because they know that you are here to complete
a deal entered into with the French Government in
connection with your wonderful seaplane before this
war was dreamed of. They would be willing to do
something to prevent you from standing between their
plans and the securing or destroying of the machine
in the hangar.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I had not thought of it in that light,” said Frank,
disturbed more or less.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pardon me for saying it,” continued the Major,
“but they understand that if you could only be made
to disappear your companions would be much easier
to hoodwink, and their plans looking toward destroying
the <em>Sea Eagle</em> would be crowned with success.
You will be doubly careful, Frank, I hope.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The boy promised this. Even though he might not
be willing to admit that these secret agents of the
Kaiser would dream of attempting any violence, at
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_144' id='Page_144'>144</a></span>
the same time he saw the soldier was really concerned
about him.</p>

<p class='c009'>So they parted with mutual good wishes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank found himself again on the streets of the
French seacoast city. Dunkirk was a far different
place in these strenuous war times from the other
days, when peace lay upon the land, and men went
about their customary vocations of fishing, trading,
and disposing of the products of the rich soil.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now everywhere he looked Frank could see soldiers,
and then more soldiers. They thronged the
principal streets, and passed in and out of the shops
buying things that appealed to their fancy. There
were all manner of strange foreign troops to be met
with—Gurkhas from far-away India; Canadians who
resembled the Rough Riders of our own Spanish War
times; Colonials from Australia or New Zealand; and
many others who interested the boy very much.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then, with the warning of Major Nixon still ringing
in his ears, Frank suddenly became aware of the
fact that he himself was an object of interest, though
there was nothing about his make-up calculated to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_145' id='Page_145'>145</a></span>
attract attention in all that strange collection of men
from the four quarters of the globe.</p>

<p class='c009'>Several times, on glancing hastily about him, he had
noticed a certain man dressed like a citizen apparently
staring into the window of a store. Frank began
to believe the man was following him, and so he made
a test to prove it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I like that, now,” he said to himself, with a chuckle
when again he found that he had not shaken the unknown
off his track by slipping into a certain side
street, for the man was standing there on the curb as
he turned, and calmly brushing his sleeve as though
utterly unconcerned.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wonder if they would dare try to stop me on the
way to the hangar,” Frank was asking himself, though
he immediately added: “that’s hardly likely, for
there’s really no time when I’m out of sight of soldiers
on the road, because they’re going and coming
constantly. I could even fall in behind a regiment if
I wanted, and have plenty of company all the way to
the gates of our compound.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Just then he found himself attracted by the actions
of a couple ahead of him, a man of middle age and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_146' id='Page_146'>146</a></span>
a woman. Apparently she had been seized with some
sort of vertigo, for the man was acting as though
dreadfully alarmed. He had thrown an arm about
her, and was looking around in an appealing way.</p>

<p class='c009'>It happened that Frank was about the only person
nearby, and it was only natural for him to hasten
forward.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! please help me support my wife, young sir!”
exclaimed the citizen as Frank arrived. “She is fainting,
and just when we had reached our home here.
Would you mind supporting her on the other side,
and assisting me to get her to the door?”</p>

<p class='c009'>An appeal like that could not be easily resisted,
especially by one so ready to help others as Frank
Chester had always been in the past.</p>

<p class='c009'>Somehow it did not appear to strike him as singular
that the citizen should be so fluent in his English
when he was supposed to be a Frenchman. All Frank
thought of then was that the man was in difficulties,
and it would be next to nothing for him to lend the
other a helping hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>So he took hold on the other side of the woman
who was acting as though swooning. Frank could
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_147' id='Page_147'>147</a></span>
not but notice that she appeared anything but fragile.</p>

<p class='c009'>The door of the modest looking house was close
by, and between them he and the distracted husband
managed to half lead, half drag, the fainting woman
up to it. The man immediately opened the door with
one hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Please assist me a little further, and I will be so
thankful!” he pleaded.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank might have actually entered the house, only
for a little thing that he had noticed. As they approached
the door he had seen the man cast a quick
glance upward toward the second story. The latticed
blinds were shut, but as Frank used his eyes
to advantage he believed he saw someone’s face back
of the screen.</p>

<p class='c009'>Like a flash it struck him that the man must have
made some sort of quick signal to the party who was
hidden up there. Frank became cautious in that second,
remembering the warning given him by Major
Nixon.</p>

<p class='c009'>These spies were up to all manner of trickery in
order to carry out their well-laid plans, and might not
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_148' id='Page_148'>148</a></span>
this pretended swooning of the woman be only a bait
intended to coax him into a trap?</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank immediately released his hold of the woman,
and he noticed that she did not appear to be in danger
of falling after he had withdrawn his support,
which in itself was a suspicious sign.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! I hope you will help me just a little further!”
exclaimed the man. “Inside is a chair, and if we
could place her in that it is all I could ask of you.
Thank you a thousand times for what you have done
already; but do not leave me just yet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It seemed hard to refuse, but Frank steeled his
heart. He was positive by now he had been made a
victim to a deep-laid plot, and if he but stepped within
that open door something unpleasant was sure to happen
to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You will have to excuse me, but I can go no further,”
he said hastily.</p>

<p class='c009'>The man said something half under his breath.
Frank saw that the woman was apparently suddenly
regaining her senses, for she had thrown out a hand,
and seemed to be trying to clutch hold of his sleeve.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boy had no difficulty in avoiding the contact,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_149' id='Page_149'>149</a></span>
however, thanks to his suspicions. He dodged back,
and then with a smile turned and walked quickly
away. When he glanced over his shoulder a minute
later the couple had vanished, evidently going into
the house, which Frank could imagine must be a nest
of spies.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That was a pretty close call for me,” he was saying
to himself as he walked on; “and I can imagine
there’ll be a hurried exodus from that building inside
of a few minutes if I cared to hang around and
watch. They’ll be afraid that I may tell on them,
and have the soldiers surround the place. But it
isn’t my business as a neutral to have German spies
arrested and shot.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank sauntered on. He had a few errands to
attend to, some small supplies to purchase connected
with the seaplane, for new wants were constantly
cropping up in that line.</p>

<p class='c009'>The little adventure caused his blood to warm up,
but Frank had been through so much in his past that
he had by this time come to take such things as a
matter of course, and accept them philosophically.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If that was intended for a stall,” he said to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_150' id='Page_150'>150</a></span>
himself presently, “it shows how desperate they’re getting
about our disposing of the <em>Sea Eagle</em> to the
French Government. Why, you’d think orders had
gone out in Berlin to prevent the transfer by hook or
by crook. Certain it is these people are risking their
lives in the effort. But they will have to get up pretty
early in the morning to best us, that’s all I can say,
even if it does sound like boasting.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Though remaining watchful, he was soon busy
with his errands. No one brushed elbows with him
in the stores but that Frank used his eyes to take note.
Those who could arrange such an ingenious scheme
as that swooning lady and the call upon him for assistance
might be equal to other games of like character.</p>

<p class='c009'>He managed to accomplish his several duties without
any further cause for alarm, and was once more
on the streets observing all that happened. A constantly
increasing push of eager observers toward a
certain point told Frank there must be something
of an unusual interest taking place there, and consumed
by the same curiosity he joined the throng,
for he had heard someone say the ambulances with
the wounded had just come in from the front.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_151' id='Page_151'>151</a></span>
  <h2 id='chXIV' class='c010'>CHAPTER XIV.<br /> <br />THE PERIL IN THE SKY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Day after day the wounded from the front were
being received in Dunkirk, Calais and other places
along the coast. They were usually taken further
on as soon as their immediate wants could be attended
to.</p>

<p class='c009'>In many cases the stricken soldiers would be carried
by train to the large Red Cross hospitals in and
around Paris. Then besides this, on many a night
a steamer would start from Dunkirk across the Channel
bearing hundreds of British back to their own
shores, where they could receive the best of care
among their people. These voyages were made when
possible in the gloom of night, and at full speed, in
order to avoid the risk of having the vessel torpedoed
by lurking German submarines, ready to deliver
crushing blows to her enemy’s ships.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank stood in the crowd and watched the transfer
of the poor fellows to the temporary hospital.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_152' id='Page_152'>152</a></span>
They were mostly British soldiers who had received
their injuries while trying to hold the trenches against
some fierce drive on the part of Bavarians or Prussians.</p>

<p class='c009'>As he saw one after another swathed figure borne
on stretchers from the ambulance motors into the hospital,
Frank felt a sense of pity for all these who
were suffering on account of this terrible war, no
matter on which side they chanced to be.</p>

<p class='c009'>He finally turned away, not caring to see any more
such pitiful sights. He marveled at the brave front
displayed by even the most dreadfully wounded men,
who tried to greet the crowd and smiled through the
mud that plastered their faces.</p>

<p class='c009'>Remembering what he and Billy had discovered in
connection with the gathering of a new army back
of the German trenches, Frank expected that in a
few days there was bound to be a greater stream of
wounded pouring into Dunkirk than ever before, because
a desperate attack was doubtless contemplated.</p>

<p class='c009'>When he learned from Major Nixon that some of
the Allies’ aviators had brought in the news concerning
that gathering host of gray-clad soldiers, Frank
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_153' id='Page_153'>153</a></span>
realized that he could speak of it without reservation,
since it would not be giving information as to the
enemy’s contemplated plans.</p>

<p class='c009'>Remembering one more errand which needed his
attention, Frank, after leaving the vicinity of the
Red Cross hospital, had immediately started to look
after it. He was through with it and actually starting
for the hangar when once again he became aware
of the fact that a sudden confusion had broken out.
People were shouting in an excited manner, as though
a mad dog had broken loose and was coming down
the main street of Dunkirk.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no difficulty in learning what was the
matter. That wild cry of alarm was becoming very
familiar to the ears of the worried citizens of Dunkirk
these stormy days.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Germans are coming! The Germans are
coming!”</p>

<p class='c009'>In French and in English this shout was being
carried along, constantly added to by scores of
voices. People rushed pell-mell this way and that,
many dodging down into cellars, as though seeking
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_154' id='Page_154'>154</a></span>
safety from some terror that was likely to descend on
the coast city like a cyclone.</p>

<p class='c009'>Those who were not yet running had their necks
craned, and their eyes turned upward toward the
northeast. Frank stepped over to where he could see
better, and then he also “rubbered,” as Billy would
have called it.</p>

<p class='c009'>On numerous occasions the German aviators had
conducted an organized raid on Dunkirk, dropping
dozens of terrible bombs in what seemed like an indiscriminate
fashion. Possibly these were in the main
intended to damage the camps or accumulated stores
of the British legions; but if so the aim of the men
in the Taubes was singularly bad, for the majority
of the bombs had thus far either exploded in the
open streets, or shattered private houses.</p>

<p class='c009'>Many innocent persons, including women and children,
had suffered from these explosives, and it was
not singular then that whenever the cry was raised
that the “Germans were coming,” meaning a raiding
flock of aëroplanes, there would ensue a mad panic
in the streets of the French city.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There are several moving things over there away
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_155' id='Page_155'>155</a></span>
up in the heavens,” Frank told himself as he gazed
in more or less excitement. “Even without a glass
I’m almost ready to say they can’t be Taubes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He stood there watching and waiting until the soaring
objects drew closer, when their true identity could
be discovered.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank, being an aviator himself, quickly detected
certain things that the common observer might never
have discovered; and which told him the half dozen
specks in the sky that February morning were birds
and not aëroplanes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Some gulls flying high,” he murmured as he
watched. “Yes, there they circle around, which aviators
bent on bombarding the city and then running
off in a hurry would never think of doing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He told those near him that there was nothing to
fear, as the suspected Taubes were only harmless
birds. The cheering word was passed along from
mouth to mouth, and some of those who only a few
minutes before were looking very peaked and white
commenced to laugh, trying to make out that they
knew all along the advancing specks were only birds.</p>

<p class='c009'>By degrees even the shivering inmates of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_156' id='Page_156'>156</a></span>
cellars learned that it was a false alarm, and ventured
to appear again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And I suppose this happens several times every
day,” Frank mused as he watched the arteries of
traffic once more begin to flow naturally. “While
little damage that amounts to anything has been done
by the bombs, the coming of the Germans is looked
forward to with dread. I suppose if a flier happened
to be brought down with a well directed shot from
a gun it would give the people more pleasure than
anything they could wish for.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It struck him that possibly the other boys might
have heard something of all this excitement and would
be worried about him. So Frank stepped into a store
he knew of and proceeded to get the hangar on the
wire. There was some little difficulty at first, as
though a good many people were trying to communicate
with their homes for some purpose or other.
Finally a voice called in good English:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hello! that you, Frank?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, that’s who it is, Billy. I only called you up
thinking you might have heard all the shouting, and
wonder what it was.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_157' id='Page_157'>157</a></span>
“Oh! some of the guards here guessed it, and we’ve
been watching the gulls through our field glass. But
how about the other business, Frank; is it all fixed?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m coming back right away,” Frank told him.
“Soon after I join you, there will be something doing.
I’ll tell you the rest when I get there; but everything
is going on O. K. So-long, Billy. Keep watching,
for they’re ready to try everything under the sun
to gain their end. I’ve got a new story for you when
I come.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank by this action had not only accomplished his
purpose of relieving the minds of his chums, but at
the same time he had made sure that things were unchanged
at the hangar.</p>

<p class='c009'>Determined not to take any risks that could be
avoided, Frank waited until he saw a battery of field-pieces
moving along the road that led close by the
gate of the hangar. Perhaps the guns had come over
from England on the previous night, and being badly
needed at the front, were starting forth.</p>

<p class='c009'>This was the opportunity he wanted. By keeping
alongside the guns and caissons he could defy any
hidden danger. If there were spies waiting to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_158' id='Page_158'>158</a></span>
waylay him in some rather lonely spot, just as they had
Pudge on the preceding night, the presence of those
young khaki-clad warriors seated on the gun carriages
and ammunition carts would foil them.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no trouble. Possibly Frank might not
have been held up even though he chose to take the
walk without any protection; but when in doubt it
was always his policy to “play safe.”</p>

<p class='c009'>When he again found himself in the hangar, the
others were eager to hear what he had promised to
tell them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ve been having another scrape of some sort,
like as not,” ventured Billy, pretending to look morose,
as though he begrudged his comrade that privilege
while he and Pudge were only sitting there killing
time.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank thereupon related how he had been drawn
into rendering assistance when the said-to-be wife of
an apparent citizen of Dunkirk, who spoke excellent
English without a French accent, appeared to faint
close to the door of her own home.</p>

<p class='c009'>The other boys were thrilled by what seemed like
a narrow escape on the part of their comrade.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_159' id='Page_159'>159</a></span>
“Ganders and gridirons, Frank!” exploded Pudge
after listening with distended eyes to the account given
by the returned chum. “That was a narrow squeak
for you, as sure as anything.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” added Billy, “they had it all laid out to trap
you. If you’d dared to step inside that open door I
reckon you’d have been tapped over the head, and
when you came to again it would be to find yourself
in some old damp and moldy cellar. I give you credit
for tumbling to their smart game, Frank.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bayous and bullfrogs, they certainly do want to
get hold of this bully machine of ours the worst kind,
and that’s a fact!” spluttered Pudge.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But tell us about the Major, and what he agreed
to do?” asked Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s all fixed just as we figured it,” replied Frank.
“I want this man here to understand what has been
done, so come over to where you’ve got him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The prisoner had been watching them eagerly. He
must have guessed that Frank had been gone to settle
about his fate, and, if ever a man looked nervous, he
did, as the three boys advanced toward him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Listen to something I want you to hear,” said
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_160' id='Page_160'>160</a></span>
Frank. “We know what you are, and that if you
were given in charge as a spy you’d likely be shot by
to-morrow morning. But we are American boys, and
not at all inclined to have the blood of a German
honestly serving his Fatherland on our hands. Do
you understand what I am saying?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, go on,” muttered the man, brightening up,
though still anxious.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have arranged it with the authorities that you
will only be looked on as a petty thief. You will be
held in close confinement for a few days until it is
certain that any information you may have picked up
while here in this building will be useless. Then they
will take you out of the city and set you free, with
a warning never to be seen here again if you value
your life.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Now the man’s face lighted up in a smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is much better,” he said, after drawing a long
breath of relief. “We thought you were on the side
of the Allies, because you meant to turn <em>it</em> over to
the French Government.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You must remember,” said Frank impressively,
“that this machine had been over here, boxed but not
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_161' id='Page_161'>161</a></span>
assembled, for months before the war opened. My
company had a contract with the French people, who
insisted on representatives being sent across to demonstrate
the new flier; otherwise they threatened to seize
it, and make duplicates without our receiving any
remuneration—the necessities of war. That is why
we have come, and are even now trying to carry out
the terms of that agreement. You can tell your people
that only for this our company would not dream
of making aëroplanes for one side or the other. They
could not be shipped out of the United States, anyway.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I understand your position,” said the man; “and
while it explains many things it does not change our
design to prevent the enemy from profiting by your
improved type of machine. If by any means it can
be stolen or destroyed we believe we are only doing
our duty by the Fatherland in risking our lives to
attempt it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, here comes the patrol to take you to the city
prison; and, remember, you are to insist that you
entered our hangar to steal, not to spy on us,” Frank
told him.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_162' id='Page_162'>162</a></span>
  <h2 id='chXV' class='c010'>CHAPTER XV.<br /> <br />ON GUARD.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“You will restore to me my papers, I hope?” remarked
the man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you mean the naturalization papers that stamp
you as one Hans Larsen, formerly of Sweden,” replied
Frank, “I am going to put them in your inside
pocket. But they will be taken by the officials, and
I doubt if you ever see them again. They must know
they are either stolen, bought, or forged, and that you
only carry them to give trouble in case you are arrested.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He was as good as his word, for he had taken the
papers to show the Major in case any proof were desired
after his story had been told.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then came the file of British soldiers, direct from
Major Nixon. They brought a note from the officer
to Frank and his chums, desiring that the prisoner
be turned over, and also stating that the word he had
given Frank would be religiously kept.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_163' id='Page_163'>163</a></span>
The spy walked away in the midst of his guards,
who had orders not to let him communicate with
anyone on the way. In order to make more positive
of this, they had a covered wagon close by, in which
he was to be conveyed to the jail.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m glad we’re free from him,” said Billy, after
they had watched the party leaving the stockade.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You don’t think there would be any attempt made
at trying to rescue him while they’re on the way?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sugar and sandwiches, but I should hope not!”
exclaimed Pudge.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank did not seem to be worrying about such a
remote possibility.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I don’t think they’re numerous enough to
risk an encounter with a dozen armed Tommies looking
for trouble, just as Pudge here would look for
his breakfast,” he observed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now we’ve got the place all to ourselves,” said
Billy. “There’s such a thing as being overcrowded,
as the backwoodsman remarked when he heard that
another family had started a clearing three miles away
from his shack. But I’d like to have been down in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_164' id='Page_164'>164</a></span>
Dunkirk when they sighted those gulls coming sailing
along, ever so high up in the air.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dories and dingbats, but I warrant you there was
some excitement to the square inch,” Pudge insinuated.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank laughed as he stretched himself out on a
bench to rest.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You missed a grand sight,” he told them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lots of people scared, I take it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, they were fairly crazy,” he was told. “If
a menagerie of wild animals had broken loose and
come to town it could hardly have created more of
a panic than when that cry sounded through the
streets: ‘The Germans are coming!’ Men, women
and children all ran this way and that. Some dodged
down into cellars, while others crawled under front
door-stoops, as though that would save them in case
a bomb burst close by. It was a panic, all right, and
I never saw anything like it in all my experience.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They must have felt silly after they found out
what it really was?” Billy went on to say.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, not so very much,” he was told by the one
who had been on the spot, and was in a position to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_165' id='Page_165'>165</a></span>
relate things at first hand. “You see a good many
started to make out they knew the dots must be birds,
and said they had just been carrying on in that excited
way for a lark.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To be sure,” declared Billy, “that’s the way lots
of people always try to crawl through a little hole
when caught with the goods on. Some of the others,
I reckon, laughed it off, and admitted that they didn’t
care to be blown up; that they got plenty of that sort
of thing at home, as it was. But, Frank, how about
our own program?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You mean about staying here and being ready to
start off when we get the word—is that it, Billy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; shall we stick it out here the rest of the
day?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think,” said Frank, “none of us have any need
to leave the place again until we start the motors and
open up on the second trial spin, this time with some
of the best British aviators along to observe how the
<em>Sea Eagle</em> carries herself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you think there will be a representative of the
French Government aboard to take notes along the
way?” asked Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_166' id='Page_166'>166</a></span>
“That’s my understanding of the case,” he was
told.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, it ought to settle the matter of our business,
Frank.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just what it must,” came the reply. “We’ll give
an exhibition of all the <em>Sea Eagle</em> is capable of doing
in a way to make those other seaplanes look sick.
Then we’ll expect to have the deal closed. That’s
my understanding of the bargain.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, Frank, whatever are we going to do for eats
between now and to-morrow, when we come back
from the raid up the coast?” asked Pudge, with a
despairing expression on his fat face that would make
anyone believe he had lost his last friend; or else just
heard the news that he was to be hanged in three
hours.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve fixed all that,” the other told him, “and right
now I think I see the wagon coming with a lot of
good stuff, such as can still be had in Dunkirk if
you’ve got the francs to buy it with.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Pudge was comforted by hearing such glorious
news. He immediately took up his position outside
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_167' id='Page_167'>167</a></span>
the door from where he could keep an eye on the road
close to the stockade gates.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What are you doing out there, Pudge?” called
Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sandwiches and sauerkraut, but you wouldn’t
want to run the risk of having that grocery wagon
miss the place and drive past, would you, Billy?” demanded
the sentinel; and the others let him alone,
knowing full well that Pudge would not allow any
accident of that sort to come about as long as his
voice held good.</p>

<p class='c009'>It turned out that Frank had bought a whole assortment
of things to eat; indeed, Billy declared he
believed they could stand a siege of a whole week
with that lot of foodstuffs to fall back on.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Three days, anyhow,” assented Pudge, who evidently
had a different viewpoint from Billy when it
came to sizing up the lasting qualities of edibles.</p>

<p class='c009'>With the aid of the little stove they prepared a
lunch, and really enjoyed it immensely. Pudge seemed
to be reminiscent, for he brought up numerous half
forgotten times of the past when in company with
Harry Chester they had enjoyed many a similar
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_168' id='Page_168'>168</a></span>
repast, cooked under strange conditions it might be,
but never to be wholly forgotten by those who took
part in the feast.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then the afternoon came and it was a long one
to the three chums shut up for the most part in the
hangar. The fire was kept up in the stove, because
there was a tang to the February air so close to the
Channel.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank went carefully over every part of the seaplane
to make certain it was in the best shape possible
for the long journey they had before them under
conditions that no one could possibly foresee. He did
not mean to neglect the slightest thing that could add
to their comfort and safety.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pudge had managed to make himself a pretty cozy
nest with a couple of blankets, and he put in part
of the afternoon “making up for lost sleep,” he told
them. It was a standard joke with them that the
fat chum was always far behind in his customary allotment
of sleep; somehow or other he never did
seem able to fully catch up.</p>

<p class='c009'>Billy and Frank often stepped outside and took an
observation. This not only included the weather but
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_169' id='Page_169'>169</a></span>
the conditions existing on the harbor, where there
were boats of various descriptions to be seen, for the
most part unloading war material sent from Great
Britain in spite of Germany’s submarine warfare.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This has been a pretty good day for aërial work,
Frank,” suggested Billy. “What about the prospects
for to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think we can count on it holding about as it is
for another twenty-four hours,” came the answer,
“and then a change is about due. It’s still cold enough
to snow, and I expect we’ll meet a lot of snow squalls
when we’re making that trip up the Belgian coast.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you really believe there’ll be that many seaplanes
in the bunch—thirty or more, the Major told
us?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They have planned to make this raid a record
breaker, it looks like,” said Frank, “and will try to
get out every machine they have a pilot for. It’s
going to be a feather in our caps to be able to say we
accompanied them, no matter what amount of damage
they manage to inflict on the submarine bases, or railway
stations and gas or oil tanks of the German
army.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_170' id='Page_170'>170</a></span>
“Well, I think we’re in great luck to get the chance
to go along, Frank; though, of course, we don’t mean
to throw a single bomb, or do the least thing to harm
the Kaiser’s army. As I look at it the main purpose
of our being allowed to accompany the squad of raiders
is to let them see what cards we’re holding in this
invention of Dr. Perkins. The French Government
officials want to be shown, just as if they were from
Missouri.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They’ll see a few things calculated to make them
open their eyes, unless I miss my guess,” said Frank,
with quiet confidence; for he knew what the <em>Sea
Eagle</em> type of hydro-aëroplane was capable of doing
when properly handled, and only longed for the opportunity
of showing those British aviators, some of
them well-known air pilots, the crowning triumph of
Yankee ingenuity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s getting on toward evening now, with the sun
near setting time,” remarked Billy, as though he felt
that a load was taken from his shoulders with the
passing of that almost interminable day.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s a steamship coming in,” Frank said. “It’s
taking all sorts of chances of being torpedoed, even
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_171' id='Page_171'>171</a></span>
if the Germans have said they are holding back until
the eighteenth to start the reign of terror.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you really think the submarine blockade is
going to work?” asked Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Honestly I don’t see how it can,” Frank replied.
“They have only a certain number of the latest undersea
vessels capable of staying away from a base
for a week. These can’t be everywhere, and are
liable to be sunk by torpedo boats. I’ve no doubt the
Germans will punch holes in a good many small steamers;
but as a rule the big ones can run away from
them. I guess it’s a whole lot of a bluff, between
you and me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will Great Britain dare them to do their worst,
do you think, Frank?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, even knowing that they threaten to sink merchant
vessels and their crews of noncombatants without
giving warning. Somehow or other it does seem
to me that Germany is doing everything possible to
make outsiders distrust her. But I suppose we can’t
look at things the same way they must from inside,
especially since England threatens to <em>starve</em> Germany
into submission.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_172' id='Page_172'>172</a></span>
“There’s the sun going to set,” remarked Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>They stood and watched it go down, and the gray
of evening begin to creep across the cold sea. So
that night in February closed in. Like a grim phantom
the steamer came stealing into the harbor, with
few lights showing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s go in where it’s warm and comfortable,”
said Billy. “Frank, since we have plenty of stuff
along with us why not make an allowance of coffee
for the men who are standing guard over our plant
here. A mug of hot coffee would take the chill out
of their bones, I’m thinking.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A good idea, Billy, and thank you for suggesting
it. We’ll find what Pudge says, and carry it out.
With the lantern we can make the rounds, and see that
no sentry is omitted.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With such sentiments spurring them on, the boys
entered the hangar and found that Pudge was already
deep in the pleasing duty of getting supper ready.
Hardly had they mentioned the subject of treating
the guards to a cup of hot coffee than he announced
that he was heartily in accord with the scheme.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_173' id='Page_173'>173</a></span>
  <h2 id='chXVI' class='c010'>CHAPTER XVI.<br /> <br />THE COMING OF THE DAWN.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Just in time to help me out in planning a bill of
fare for supper, too,” Pudge told them. “There are
some tinned meats here, but I’d prefer something
good and warm.”</p>

<p class='c009'>That difficulty was soon swept aside, for the others
nominated several dishes they chanced to be exceedingly
fond of, and Pudge found he was going to
have his hands full preparing them with such limited
accommodations.</p>

<p class='c009'>However, willing hands make light work, and both
Frank and Billy were ready to give him all the assistance
required; so that in the end they had quite
a feast spread upon the little drop-table that took
up no space at all when not required for use.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a peculiar supper-setting, with only that one
lantern to give them light. Of course they could
have used the acetylene lamps, but their supply of
carbide was rather low, and there could be no
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_174' id='Page_174'>174</a></span>
certainty about obtaining a further amount, so Frank
thought it best to husband what they had.</p>

<p class='c009'>The weird appearance of the big seaplane added
more or less to the strangeness of their surroundings.
Still, by this time, all of the boys had become so accustomed
to seeing its bat-like wings, and the boat
body with the spoon-shaped bow that they would have
missed it had the hangar been empty.</p>

<p class='c009'>Over the meal they chatted in low tones, discussing
many things connected with their mission across
the sea. Little was said concerning the contemplated
dash laid out for the following morning, because in
the first place they knew none of the particulars; and
then again the raid was the Allies’ secret, not theirs.</p>

<p class='c009'>The unexpected presence of that concealed spy had
given them a rude jolt. They appeared to be living
in an atmosphere of espionage; and somehow it seemed
as though hostile eyes and ears might be close by,
even though unseen.</p>

<p class='c009'>When finally they were through, it was remembered
that they had decided to give the chilled guards a
treat; so Pudge brewed a copious amount of strong
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_175' id='Page_175'>175</a></span>
coffee that was of a rich dark color, and had the
“odor of ambrosia,” as Billy called it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Since you’ve done so much, Pudge,” remarked
Frank, “you’re going to be the one to go along with
me on the rounds. So get that big tin cup, and we’ll
carry the can of condensed Swiss milk with us. We
might as well give them the coffee just as they fancy
it, either black or with the fixings.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Pudge beamed on his chum. Evidently he had not
expected to be favored with an invitation like this;
for as a rule he was apt to be left behind on account
of his well-known clumsiness.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank, however, was wise enough to carry the
steaming pot of coffee himself, as an insurance
against spilling. If Pudge did happen to trip over
some unseen obstruction and measure his length he
could hardly do worse than spill the thick condensed
milk, or dent the big tin cup.</p>

<p class='c009'>So they started forth, and coming to the gate first
of all surprised the two khaki-clad Tommies there.
How eagerly they in turn quaffed the contents of that
common tin cup can be imagined, for the night air
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_176' id='Page_176'>176</a></span>
was growing cold, and a dismal prospect stared them
in the face.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank carried the lantern in one hand; it was in
the dark of the moon, and he meant that none of
the guards should make a mistake and fire upon them
for unwelcome prowlers.</p>

<p class='c009'>News of their coming was sent on ahead, each
sentinel calling out to the next one; and in this way
the boys made the complete rounds, neglecting none.</p>

<p class='c009'>When they finally returned to the building it was
with an empty pot, and the satisfaction of knowing
they had done something to cheer up the brave fellows
who were protecting their property.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank himself went the rounds of the hangar once
more to make sure that everything was as it should
be. There was a sense of responsibility resting on
him that the others did not feel in the same degree,
for Billy was one of those care-free individuals, and
as for Pudge, did you ever know of a fat, good-natured
boy worrying?</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope we don’t have any trouble between now
and dawn,” Billy was heard to say as they began to
get things ready for sleeping, each having a blanket,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_177' id='Page_177'>177</a></span>
as well as some cushions with which to form a rude
bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, because to-morrow ought to be a big day
for the <em>Sea Eagle Company, Limited</em>,” added Pudge,
swelling a little with pride as he pronounced that
name. “In fact, it promises to eclipse anything we’ve
ever stacked up against before in all our travels.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was all very fine,” commented Billy, “to knock
around the Moon Mountains in Africa, meeting up
with wild beasts and wilder men; it was thrilling to
be away down there in the frozen regions of the Antarctic;
but let me tell you all those happenings rolled
into one couldn’t equal a trip over the fighting lines
of two great armies in a death grapple along the
trenches.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m not going to get one wink of sleep this whole
night, thinking about it,” asserted Pudge, shaking his
head in a sad fashion; but somehow his threat did
not seem to give either of his chums the slightest
degree of anxiety, for they knew what an enormous
propensity Pudge had for sleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>It may have been about ten o’clock when they all
lay down and tried to lose themselves in slumber.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_178' id='Page_178'>178</a></span>
The lantern had been extinguished, but Frank had
things fixed so that if any sudden necessity arose
he could press a button that was close by his hand
and illuminate the interior of the hangar with the
searchlight connected with the seaplane.</p>

<p class='c009'>Just as they expected, Pudge was breathing stertorously
before seven minutes had crept by, proving his
dismal foreboding to have been an empty threat.
Billy was the next one to drop off; and finally Frank,
too, lost track of things after he had tried various
expedients in the hope of forgetting himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>They were aroused by a sudden loud noise that
sounded like an explosion. All of them sat upright
as though brought in contact with a galvanic battery;
but Frank desisted even when his hand was in the
act of reaching for the button connected with the
light.</p>

<p class='c009'>If that had been a bursting bomb dropped by some
hovering German Taube, for him to betray the exact
position of the hangar by starting up the brilliant
electric searchlight would be the height of folly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What could that have been, Frank?” Pudge was
asking in trembling tones; for as it afterward turned
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_179' id='Page_179'>179</a></span>
out he had been having a weird dream, and his first
thought on being so rudely aroused was that the top
of a volcano he was exploring had been blown off by
an eruption, sending him a mile high.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Germans have made a night raid, and are
trying to smash the <em>Sea Eagle</em>, after seeing what she
could do to their machines and dirigibles!” declared
Billy, as if his mind had already been made up.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you think so too, Frank; and are we apt to
be blown up any second now by a better aimed bomb
than that first one?” Pudge demanded, evidently trying
hard to control himself, and show that he could
face danger with an undaunted front.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank had had time to think. He realized that
several things conflicted with such an explanation of
the mysterious explosion. Voices, too, outside could
be heard, and it was evident that the guards were
calling to one another.</p>

<p class='c009'>“On second thought,” Frank ventured to say, “I
don’t believe that could have been a bomb. It didn’t
make near enough noise, though perhaps we thought
it pretty loud on being waked up so suddenly.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_180' id='Page_180'>180</a></span>
“Then what could it have been, Frank?” demanded
Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve got an idea one of the guards may have
fired at some prowler,” replied the other; “in a minute
or so I’ll take the lantern and go out to see.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He insisted on going alone, and the other two remained
back of the barred door awaiting his report.
Frank was gone about twenty minutes when his signal
was heard on the other side of the door. Upon
being admitted he at once eased their fears.</p>

<p class='c009'>“After all, it was the discharge of a gun, just as
we guessed,” he observed. “One of the guards believed
he saw a shadowy figure creeping along. He
challenged, and on hearing the bushes shake as the
unknown started away, the sentry shot.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps, after all, it was a false alarm?” suggested
Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, it was a prowler, all right,” said Frank, “for
the sergeant and myself went out to where he told
us he had aimed, and we found not only footprints
in the dirt, but specks of blood as well, showing that
the soldier had winged the spy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tamales and terrapins, but that is thrilling news,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_181' id='Page_181'>181</a></span>
Frank!” exclaimed Pudge. “Did you try to follow
the trail, and see if the poor fellow was lying around
anywhere?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It made for the road, and we lost it there,” said
Frank. “I reckon it was not a very severe wound,
for while the man evidently limped he did not lose
much blood. Not wanting to be away from the
hangar any longer than we could help, the sergeant
and myself came back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“One good thing,” remarked Billy, “those chaps
will have learned that we are on the job, all right.
They’ll be careful how they come sneaking around
here again, or try to blow up our plant. What time
is it now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just two o’clock,” announced Pudge, referring to
his nickel watch by the light of the lantern which
had not as yet been extinguished.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Between four and five hours more to put in before
day comes ‘a-peeping over the hills,’” half sang
Billy, as he started to arrange his rude bed again,
for in the haste of their turning out, things had been
thrown aside rather recklessly.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no further alarm that night.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_182' id='Page_182'>182</a></span>
Apparently, those who would have given much to have
wrecked the hangar with its contents, so as to prevent
its being taken over by the French military authorities,
feared to again approach the guarded
stockade.</p>

<p class='c009'>Billy, after all, was the first to discover signs of
dawn through the window which was secured with
the heavy wire mesh. He immediately aroused the
others and they proceeded to get the coffee on the
stove.</p>

<p class='c009'>Just when they would receive the signal was uncertain;
so that it was considered the part of wisdom
to be prepared in advance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wonder where we’ll take the next meal,” Pudge
remarked, as they sat there at the table and satisfied
their appetites with what had been prepared.</p>

<p class='c009'>Billy was about to make some sort of grim joke
on the possibility of their not ever needing another
“feed,” but on second thought he desisted. It was
not a subject to be made fun of, he concluded, because
the danger of an accident was always in evidence
when far up among the clouds.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll make up a snack to take along with us,”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_183' id='Page_183'>183</a></span>
said wise Frank. “It may come in handy, you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pumpkins and partridges, but it does take you to
think up things, Frank!” cried Pudge, beaming on his
comrade, for that proposal was right in his line of
weakness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s someone at the door, Frank!” announced
Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>The day was coming on, as Frank could see when
he partly opened the door. He discovered a stranger
standing there, a swarthy looking, slender man, who
was apparently a Frenchman, if appearances went for
anything.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pardon, but have I the pleasure of addressing
M’sieu Frank Chester?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is my name,” replied the boy. “Have you
come from Major Nixon?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have a letter here from that gentleman,” said
the other. “It is to prove that my identity is correct.
For I am to accompany you on this interesting trip,
to discover what strong points your seaplane develops.
My name, young M’sieu, is Armand Le
Grande.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank was thrilled when he heard the name, for
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_184' id='Page_184'>184</a></span>
he knew that Major Nixon had been wise enough to
send one of the most famous of all French aviators
to accompany the <em>Sea Eagle</em> on its dangerous mission.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_185' id='Page_185'>185</a></span>
  <h2 id='chXVII' class='c010'>CHAPTER XVII.<br /> <br />NEWS BY WIRELESS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Frank immediately opened wide the door and bade
the other welcome. He even held out his hand, and
made the French aviator feel that they were delighted
to know he was to be with them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“First of all be pleased to read what Major Nixon
has written here,” said M. Le Grande, after being
introduced to the other boys, who were surveying
him with natural curiosity, because they, too, recognized
his well-known name.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank quickly read the contents of the note. It
was to the point, for the British officer was a man
of comparatively few words.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My Dear Frank:</p>

<p class='c012'>With this I introduce my friend Monsieur Armand
Le Grande. You know what he has done in your
line. He will be your passenger on the trial trip. Remember,
you are the sole commander, as M. Le
Grande is there simply to take notes, and advise, if
you care to ask his valued opinion at any time. The
best of luck to you all, and may this day be one never
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_186' id='Page_186'>186</a></span>
to be forgotten, both here and in the tight little island
across the Channel. When we receive word by wireless,
I shall let you know over the phone.</p>

<div class='c013'>Yours sincerely,</div>
<div class='c013'><span class='sc'>John Nixon</span>, Major.”</div>

<p class='c014'>Since Frank knew the handwriting well he could
not have any doubt concerning the authenticity of
the letter. It happened that he had also seen pictures
of the noted French birdman, and they corresponded
with the features of the man who had come to them.</p>

<p class='c009'>If Frank, therefore, had in the beginning entertained
the slightest suspicion, it was by now wholly allayed.
Sitting there while the newcomer enjoyed a
cup of black coffee, they talked in low tones of the
contemplated voyage.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was wonderful to see how calmly they discussed
the tremendous possibilities of the great raid by aëroplanes
on the enemy’s works. Ten years back, had
anyone ventured to affirm that in so short a time
scouts would be sailing through the upper currents at
the rate of two miles a minute, and even “looping the
loop” in a desire to prove their mastery over air, he
would have been set down as visionary and a dreamer.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank went to the double doors opening on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_187' id='Page_187'>187</a></span>
trestle that ran down to the water and took an observation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is some haze on the sea,” he announced,
“but it is rising, and I think we are going to have
a fair day for the trip.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They had made all preparations, so that when the
summons came there should be no occasion for unnecessary
delay. Knowing that they would find it
bitterly cold far up among the clouds while moving
at high speed, all of them were careful to don the
warmest clothing possible. As they wandered about
the interior of the hangar they resembled mummies
to some degree; but appearances count for little with
the venturesome men who risk their lives while emulating
the birds.</p>

<p class='c009'>All at once there was a quick angry buzz.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The ’phone, Frank!” cried Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank darted over and clapped the French receiver
to his ear.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hello!” he called.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who is it?” asked a voice he recognized as belonging
to the Major.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Frank Chester; is that you, Major Nixon?”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_188' id='Page_188'>188</a></span>
“Yes, has he arrived, Frank?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you mean M’sieu Le Grande, yes. He’s here
with us, waiting for the time to come when we make
the start.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, it is here. I have called you up to tell you,
Frank.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you received a message by wireless from
across the Channel, sir?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We have,” replied the Major. “It told us that
the fleet had started from Dover cliffs, and would be
across in less than half an hour, if all went well.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good news! You make us happy when you say
that. Shall we get out at once and be ready to join
them when they show up?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lose no time, for they may be here sooner than
expected; and again the best of luck go with you,
Frank, my boy. May you and your chums return in
safety, and your passenger bring back a glowing report.
That’s all; now get busy!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank swung around. His young face fairly
glowed with animation and expectation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How about it, Frank?” asked Billy, as nervous
as ever.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_189' id='Page_189'>189</a></span>
“They’re on the wing and heading this way.
Everybody get aboard while I fling open the doors
and fix it to start!”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no confusion because they all knew exactly
what was expected of them, and everyone had
his place arranged.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank swung aboard as the big seaplane began to
move. In another second they had passed beyond
the doors and commenced to descend the trestle leading
to the surface of the bay.</p>

<p class='c009'>The seaplane took the water with the grace of a
swan. There was something of a splash when the
connection was made, but that odd bow so like a spoon
had been built especially to spurn the water, and so
the craft skimmed along just as a flat stone hurled
by a boy’s hand will skip over the surface until its
momentum has been exhausted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s something of a crowd over there watching
us, Frank!” announced Billy, as he pointed to
the shore, at some little distance away.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Could they have known about what we expected
to do,” remarked Pudge, “or is it just the idle crowd
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_190' id='Page_190'>190</a></span>
that was chased away yesterday by the guard, come
to see what’s on the program for to-day?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The chances are some of those spies are among
the lot,” Billy said at a hazard.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If they are they’ll be kicking themselves soon because
they can’t get word to their friends up the
coast,” Pudge continued, looking as though he considered
that he might be going to have the time of
his life, as no doubt he was.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank did not start up. There was no necessity
for doing it, since he had no desire to show off before
the Dunkirk people, and it was the part of wisdom
to conserve all his resources for the strain that awaited
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had his field glasses in his hand, and with these
he now began to scan the heavens toward the west,
veering a little to the northwest. The others waited
anxiously to hear what he might discover.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing in sight from here,” announced Frank;
“but then that was to be expected. We are low down
on the water, and there are more or less streaks of
haze in the air to interfere with a good view.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_191' id='Page_191'>191</a></span>
“It’s too soon to look for them, anyway,” added
Pudge.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How long do they expect to be on the journey
across the Channel, Frank?” Billy inquired.</p>

<p class='c009'>“From what Major Nixon said, I should guess from
twenty minutes to half an hour,” Frank explained.
“It all depends on what air currents they strike, and
whether they meet with any accidents on the way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s our friend the sergeant waving to us from
the shore,” announced Billy. “He doesn’t know
what’s going on, but he wants you to understand he
wishes you all kinds of good luck.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” suddenly cried Pudge, “what’s that over
there, Frank! Focus your glass on it and tell me!
I hope it isn’t one of those sassy little Taube machines
come to bother us just when we want to be let alone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No fear,” he was told by Frank as soon as he
caught the far distant object that had caused this
outbreak on the part of the fat boy. “That’s only a
gull circling around in the sunlight.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hadn’t we better be up so we can join the fleet
without wasting any time?” asked Billy</p>

<p class='c009'>“No need,” Frank assured him. “I understand that
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_192' id='Page_192'>192</a></span>
they mean to swing in here, and then make a fresh
start straight away up the shore.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But why should they come in here at all, when
they could just as well have headed straight from
Dover to Antwerp and Zeebrugge?” demanded Billy,
who with that reporter instinct of his always wanted
to know the why and wherefore of everything.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There are several reasons, I believe,” Frank went
on to say. “For thirty seaplanes to cross the Channel
with its variable winds is a big feat, and it was to
make sure all was well with each member of the fleet
that they laid out to start fresh from here. Then, I
fancy, several other machines are waiting here to join
them, so as to make the raid as big as possible, and
strike a note of alarm along the naval bases of the
coast.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now I understand better,” admitted the other, always
willing to listen to any explanation given by
Frank, for whose opinion he entertained considerable
respect.</p>

<p class='c009'>The minutes dragged. Even Pudge manifested unusual
impatience, and kept craning his fat neck in
the endeavor to scan the sky toward the west, as
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_193' id='Page_193'>193</a></span>
though in hopes of making a pleasing discovery ahead
of Frank with his glasses.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There goes one man up in his biplane!” remarked
Billy, who had happened to turn his head and glance
back toward the city, attracted possibly by a distant
humming sound that was strangely familiar.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And a second following him in a monoplane,”
added Pudge. “I suppose now those fellows will join
the squad that’s meaning to do some damage to interior
points like Bruges.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Both the boys looked toward Frank appealingly, as
though they hoped he would think best to follow
suit, but he did not make the slightest move. Instead,
he held the field glasses again to his eyes as he swept
the heavens far to the west for signs of the coming
squadron of navy aëroplanes and seaplanes that had
left the cliffs of England, sailing high to avoid the
fog that lay upon the Channel there.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It must surely be twenty minutes from the time
they started by now,” urged Billy presently.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just that to a fraction,” announced Pudge, looking
to see.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They may have met with contrary winds up there
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_194' id='Page_194'>194</a></span>
and be delayed,” urged Frank. “Because it seems so
quiet down here is no sign that the conditions are
the same a mile high. Be patient! I expect to soon
have some good news for you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I surely hope nothing has happened to break up
the tea party, once it’s got off on the trip,” grumbled
Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pudge said nothing more, but sat there watching
Frank. He knew they would learn of the coming in
sight of the fleet first of all from the one who carried
the magnifiers; and hence he kept his eyes on
the face of his chum.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Frank lowered the glasses Pudge gave a
soft wheeze, as though he had been fairly holding his
breath meanwhile; then as soon as the other started
to look again Pudge resumed his former occupation
of watching for signs.</p>

<p class='c009'>Even the longest night must have its end, and this
absorbed vigil on the part of the fat boy was not without
receiving its reward.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Frank, on the next occasion, not only hastily
lowered the glasses but passed them along to Billy,
Pudge knew the crisis had arrived at last.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_195' id='Page_195'>195</a></span>
“There they come!” cried Billy, as soon as he had
clapped the smaller end of the field glasses to his eyes.
“Oh! what a raft of them I can see! Must be a hundred
in that bunch, Frank, anyway, all of fifty if
there’s one!”</p>

<p class='c009'>But Frank knew how Billy was prone to exaggerate,
without meaning to deceive.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let M. Le Grande take a look, Billy,” he suggested,
which aroused the other to a remembrance of
the fact that they had as their guest a most famous
aviator who should be treated with every consideration.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pudge did not ask to look. He was too busy watching
Frank, who had made as if to turn on the power
and start things going. For, after skimming over
the surface of the water, the big seaplane would mount
up like a bird on the wing.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 id='chXVIII' class='c010'>CHAPTER XVIII.<br /> <br />OFF WITH THE AIR RAIDERS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Zip! we’re off!” cried Billy, as he heard the familiar
whir of the motors, and felt the forward push
of the sea and air craft.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pudge was not so accustomed to being aboard one
of the <em>Sea Eagles</em> when starting out on a cruise. His
father, knowing the customary clumsiness of Pudge,
had preferred as a rule that the fat boy stay upon the
solid ground while his more agile chums attempted
the aërial stunts.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Pudge complained so much that Frank had
thought it best to let him accompany them on this
wonderful journey. It was likely to eclipse anything
they had ever experienced before, and must ever remain
as a memory worth while.</p>

<p class='c009'>The speed increasing, they were soon rushing over
the surface of the harbor at a furious rate. Then,
as Frank slanted the ascending rudder, they left the
water to course upward at a low angle, which,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_197' id='Page_197'>197</a></span>
however, could be increased as they circled the harbor.</p>

<p class='c009'>Loud cheers came to their ears from the shore,
where that crowd had been standing. They were
echoed, too, from several other points, showing that
all Dunkirk must be on the alert this morning, as
though it might be in the air that wonderful things
were about to transpire.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are those cheers for us, do you think, Frank, or
because they’ve discovered the fleet coming along?”
Billy asked, although he had already waved his hand
toward the shore.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s hard to tell,” Frank replied. “Though they
must have glimpsed the bunch heading this way, and
guessed what it all means. I don’t see any person
running to hide in a cellar, as they do when the Taubes
are around.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mounting higher, they waited for the arrival of
the fleet. It was a sight never before witnessed. The
air was fairly filled with buzzing seaplanes of various
patterns, jockeying for position much as is seen
on the race course before the signal to start is given
by the firing of a pistol.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Listen to all the racket, will you?” cried Pudge,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_198' id='Page_198'>198</a></span>
and indeed the noise of so many motors and whirling
propellers did sound strangely.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s like a young Niagara, that’s what I’d call it!”
declared Billy. “Why, sometimes you can’t hear
yourself think for the Bedlam that’s broken loose.
Say, tell me what the Germans up the coast will think
has struck them when this flock descends on Zeebrugge,
and batters away at the docks and the submarine
bases.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They’re all under the charge of a central seaplane,
too,” added Frank. “For, if you notice, the
signals are always sent from that one just passing
us now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>One of the muffled figures in the other aircraft
waved a hand at them. Something was said at the
same time, which Frank took for granted must be
a question as to whether they expected to accompany
the raiders.</p>

<p class='c009'>He nodded his head in the affirmative, at the same
time displaying a little red, white and blue flag he
carried, and which must have considerably astonished
the pilot of the British seaplane, evidently the chief
controller.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_199' id='Page_199'>199</a></span>
“I did that so he might know we didn’t expect to
drop any bombs, or have a part in the raid itself,”
Frank explained, turning to his companions.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They’re all worked up over seeing such a whopping
big seaplane here,” remarked Pudge, with a
touch of the old pride in his voice. “They’re having
the surprise of their lives right now, let me tell you.
I’m glad they know that it’s a Yankee machine.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, Frank, as we understand it, all these bomb-droppers
don’t intend to go to one place, do they?”
asked Billy, as he watched the whirring machines flit
past like so many big dragon flies.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” came the ready answer. “When up the coast
a piece, there’ll be a division starting inland to damage
the railway station and try to get at the supplies the
Germans have gathered at Bruges, as well as some
other points.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, what about us then?” asked Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” added Pudge, also deeply interested; “do we
go on with the seaplanes and keep tabs of what they
do up around Ostend and Zeebrugge, or else switch
off and go over the land the same as you and Billy
did yesterday?”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_200' id='Page_200'>200</a></span>
“I’ve fixed all that with M. Le Grande here,” Frank
told them. “He expressed the wish that we might
see fit to keep with the main body along the shore,
because it is expected the most spectacular feats will
be attempted there.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gee! I was hoping you’d say that, Frank!” Billy
exploded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Suits me to a dot, too!” Pudge followed by saying.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope they are going to start right away,” added
Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s a message being sent up by heliograph,”
explained Frank. “Of course, we can’t read the
flashes, but it’s meant for the man in the leading
plane. I expect it will tell him everything is all right
for the start.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He proved a true prophet, for immediately afterward
some signal was given that caused the entire
assemblage of aëroplanes to cease their evolutions
and head in a long double string up the coast.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys, despite the clattering of propellers and
the humming of many striving motors, could catch
the distant wild cheers that the assembled people of
Dunkirk sent after them. It was a benison of good
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_201' id='Page_201'>201</a></span>
wishes, and a hope that the object of the great raid
might be fully accomplished.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank kept somewhat above most of the aircraft.
He had several objects in doing this, chief of which
was the design to show that he was in a class by himself,
and not to be included in those who had come
forth to fight. Besides, it allowed them to observe
all that was going on below; as well as being in a
position to show the pilots of the fleet a few little
things connected with the strange looking <em>Sea Eagle</em>
that would cause them to feel more or less astonishment,
and envy as well.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you show them something, Frank, now that
we have the chance?” asked Pudge.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It will have to be before we get to the first place
they expect to bombard, then,” Frank replied, meaning,
of course, that once the work of the fleet began
there would be no time for any of them to manifest
any interest in the evolutions of the American built
aircraft.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Frank had moved a lever that called for all
speed, and the motors were working at the astonishing
rate of almost two thousand revolutions a minute,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_202' id='Page_202'>202</a></span>
it seemed as though they had left the rest of the fleet
far in the lurch. Green flames spouted from the
exhausts, for Frank had opened the muffler in order
to get every ounce of speed out of the motors.</p>

<p class='c009'>They could see the pilots of the other seaplanes
looking up at them in mingled wonder and admiration,
for, like the jockeys of race horses, it is the ambition
of every aviator to possess the fastest going machine
on the market.</p>

<p class='c009'>Having secured a free section of space to himself,
Frank proceeded to put the wonderful <em>Sea Eagle</em>
through her paces. He showed what could be done
in various ways, and while possibly most of those
other craft were capable of accomplishing similar
tricks, the fact was made patent that the superior
size of the American made hydro-aëroplane did not
act as a bar to the ability of the <em>Sea Eagle</em> to maneuver
in a dexterous fashion while going at that tremendous
rate of speed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now we’ll have to stop, and mount a little
higher,” Frank remarked, having circled around and
found himself once more back of the leaders in the
procession.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_203' id='Page_203'>203</a></span>
“There go several aëroplanes off to the right!” announced
Billy. “I reckon that’s the detachment told
off to tackle Bruges and other interior places.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’re coming to Ostend!” Frank told them, pointing
down to where the city of the celebrated bathing
beach could be seen, with the houses and hotels close
to the famous sandy stretch of shore.</p>

<p class='c009'>There were boats in the harbor, and they must be
German owned or they could not have come there.
Billy, using the glasses, could see that the most tremendous
excitement had seized upon every one in
sight. People were rushing in every direction, soldiers
as well as civilians; the rays of the sun glinted
on cannon that were being hastily changed, so as to
point upward.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There goes the first anti-aircraft gun!” called
Billy, as a faint boom reached their ears from far
below.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Watch what the fleet pilots do!” Frank told them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Apparently the plan had been well worked out, and
every pilot knew exactly what was expected of him.
Maps of the region had been carefully studied in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_204' id='Page_204'>204</a></span>
order that the position of each vulnerable point of
attack might be known.</p>

<p class='c009'>If there was a railway depot which the Germans
used every hour of the day, and the loss of which
would cripple their transportation facilities, that was
picked out to be an object of attack. Here was a
mole alongside of which possibly submarines tied
up, and its destruction would deprive the enemy of
a valuable station. Further on a large shed marked
the spot where great stores had been gathered, and
if a bomb could only be exploded in the midst, it
was going to mean that there would later be a shortage
of provisions. An oil tank, an ammunition magazine,
a forty-two centimeter gun, such as battered the
forts at Liège to pieces, all such were fair objects of
attack wherever they could be found. The one order
that had been given to every pilot was to avoid destroying
the property of civilians as far as possible.</p>

<p class='c009'>As Frank and his chums looked down from their
higher level they saw a sight such as had never before
been witnessed by human eyes. The air was filled
with a flock of circling, dodging aëroplanes, with puffs
of white smoke breaking above, below, and in some
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_205' id='Page_205'>205</a></span>
cases amidst them, as the guns on the ground were
fired again and again in hopes of bringing one or
more of the venturesome craft down.</p>

<p class='c009'>Various explosions far beneath proclaimed that the
bombardment from the sky was in full blast. Most
of their ammunition, however, would doubtless be
kept for the more important base at Zeebrugge, where
raiding submarines were wont to start forth on their
daring excursions through the waters of the Channel,
seeking to destroy British and French merchant
vessels or ships of war.</p>

<p class='c009'>Already the leading seaplanes had passed over the
watering place known as Ostend and which before
the war had been a famous summer resort. Doubtless
their departure would be watched with mingled
feelings by the thousands of German soldiers who
had been interested observers of this wonderful sight
in the heavens. They would also doubtless wonder
what was going to happen when the aërial fleet returned,
as it surely must, to its base at Dunkirk.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How about Antwerp?” asked Billy. “Think
they’ll take a turn up there, and drop a few reminders
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_206' id='Page_206'>206</a></span>
on the railway station, or some of the forts they say
the Germans have been building up again?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hardly think so,” Frank replied. “This is a raid
on sea coast places, as I understand it. They want to
strike at the submarine bases so as to upset the plans
of the Germans for next week, when the blockade of
the coasts of Great Britain and Northern France goes
into effect. They’ll do some damage at Bruges and
Blankenberghe I expect, just as we shied a few at
Ostend; but the main thing will happen when we get
to Zeebrugge.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think that must be the place just ahead of us
right now, Frank!” called out Billy, who was again
using the glasses, bent on seeing everything that occurred;
for he realized that they were highly favored
by fortune in being given a chance to witness such
strange sights.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, that is Zeebrugge,” Frank admitted. “Now
we’ll see something worth while, if no snow squall
comes along to shut out our view!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pirates and parachutes,” cried Pudge, “but I hope
that doesn’t happen to us.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 id='chXIX' class='c010'>CHAPTER XIX.<br /> <br />HOW ZEEBRUGGE WAS BOMBARDED.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>On their way up the coast there had been several
occasions when, for a brief space of time, as a cloud
was encountered, the onrushing fleet of seaplanes was
swathed in a flurry of blinding snow. That was why
Frank expressed the wish nothing of the kind might
occur while the bombardment of the Belgian town on
the edge of the Channel was in progress.</p>

<p class='c009'>Zeebrugge is at the terminus of a canal, and had no
sooner fallen into the hands of the Kaiser’s forces
than they realized it would make an admirable place
from which to start their submarine vessels against
the shipping accustomed to using the English
Channel.</p>

<p class='c009'>The submarines were sent there in sections and assembled
in shipyards arranged for that purpose. In
fact, as the war progressed, Zeebrugge was rapidly
becoming a very important center of military and
naval industry.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_208' id='Page_208'>208</a></span>
As Frank well knew, Antwerp might have served
the purposes of the Germans much better, but to reach
the sea, vessels would have to cross a section of Holland,
and the pugnacious little Dutch country had declared
she would resist such invasion of her rights
to the last man and vessel. As the Hollanders have
always been good fighters, with an army of half a
million men to back them, Germany had wisely chosen
to make use of Zeebrugge.</p>

<p class='c009'>Billy reported that the same excitement existed as
at Ostend. Everywhere there were men seen running,
and pointing upward toward the flock of aërial war
craft.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And I don’t blame them a bit for being scared,”
he went on to say. “Two or three aëroplanes at a
time are bad enough, but thirty in a bunch—holy
smoke! it would frighten any American community
half out of their wits, I’m thinking.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There goes the first shot at us!” announced Pudge,
and it was strange how he, unconsciously perhaps,
seemed to include the <em>Sea Eagle</em> in the list of invading
aircraft, though they did not mean to lift
a hand against the defenders of Zeebrugge.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_209' id='Page_209'>209</a></span>
“It fell far short,” observed Billy. “They’re so
worked up they hardly know what they are doing.
This time I reckon the seaplanes mean to keep above
the reach of the shrapnel.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In which they show their good sense,” Pudge replied.
“It only takes a little hit to bring an aëroplane
down to the ground; and if a pilot and his helper ever
dropped from this distance it means good-by.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Except when one of the shrapnel shells broke below
them, the air was clear enough for the boys to
see everything that went on. Billy soon began to
complain, as usual.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say, it’s ten times worse than a three-ringed circus,”
he declared. “You can’t, with so many pilots
dropping bombs while they circle around, possibly
watch more than a small part of what’s happening
down there.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Keep an eye on that mole along the edge of the
water,” advised Frank. “That is where the submarines
stay when they’re in port, and it’s being pounded
pretty lively, you notice.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But why waste so much ammunition on an empty
dock?” asked Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_210' id='Page_210'>210</a></span>
“It’s of importance that they destroy it,” Frank
explained. “I’ve got an idea they expect there may
be several submerged boats alongside the mole. Perhaps,
when the Germans had word from Ostend that
the terrible air fleet was headed this way they guessed
that the main object of the raid was to destroy their
undersea boats; so they would be apt to sink them
of their own accord, and in the natural way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They hovered over the spot, making short circles
so they could witness all that occurred. M. Le Grande
had produced binoculars from some part of his person,
and was keeping them glued to his eyes constantly.</p>

<p class='c009'>No doubt, in time to come, the boy aviators would
often picture that wonderful scene in their minds
when lying in their peaceful beds at home. With the
buzzing of the flying seaplanes that darted to and
fro, the sharp bursting of the shrapnel in furious
volleys, and the heavier sound of the guns themselves
far beneath, it certainly was an event never to be
forgotten by those fortunate enough to be able to
experience it at first hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now one of them would call the attention of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_211' id='Page_211'>211</a></span>
comrades to some special feature of the battle scene
that had caught his eye; and hardly would they rivet
their gaze upon this before something else quite as
thrilling called for notice.</p>

<p class='c009'>They could even tell when the bombs, which the
aviators were dropping, burst or failed in their intended
mission. Long practice had made the airmen
fairly accurate, though many of their missiles would
be wasted, of course, and others go wide of the mark.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sea wall was battered out of shape under the
hurricane of bombs sent at it. Further on cars and
motors were smashed when another well directed shot
burst in their midst, causing a wild stampede on
the part of a company of gray-coated Bavarians.
These men had been firing several of the guns that
could be elevated at an angle of almost fifty degrees,
and were made especially with the idea of bringing
down aircraft.</p>

<p class='c009'>Several of the hostile airmen seemed to have
marked out an oil tank as the target of their aim. It
was a small thing to strike at such a distance, and
a number of shots had gone wild. As though provoked
at such a waste of precious ammunition, one
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_212' id='Page_212'>212</a></span>
of the most venturesome of the pilots suddenly
swooped downward.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! watch him!” cried Pudge. “Now there’s going
to be something doing worth seeing. I take off
my hat to that chap for daring!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He stopped talking then, for he had to actually
hold his breath with admiration and fear while watching
the evolutions of the bold voyager of the air.</p>

<p class='c009'>The birdman swung this way and that with an eccentric
movement that effectually balked the designs
of the gunners to burst a shrapnel shell close to him.
His altitude changed constantly, so they were unable
to regulate the fuses of their shells to meet the conditions.</p>

<p class='c009'>It looked as though he were simply defying them to
do their worst, or begging a Taube of the enemy to
risk rising to engage in a duel with him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, he’s right over their heads now, for you
can hear all sorts of rifles going off in volleys,” said
Billy. “Let’s hope he keeps out of their range.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dories and dingbats, but doesn’t it beat anything
you ever heard tell of?” Pudge was heard to say as
he leaned over and watched the exciting picture;
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_213' id='Page_213'>213</a></span>
though he afterward declared it made him dizzy to
see so many seaplanes speeding this way and that like
angry bees when the hive is being robbed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Watch!” called Frank, who guessed from the
signs that the bold pilot must by this time have reached
a point where he was ready to have his assistant make
the next cast.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yes, they could see that he was leaning over now
and apparently balancing some object in his hand.
The seaplane grew somewhat steadier in its motion,
as though they were willing to take additional chances
in order to obtain stability.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There it goes!” shouted Billy, after which they
all stared, and listened to ascertain what the result of
the cast would be.</p>

<p class='c009'>There came an upheaval, accompanied by a billow
of flame and dense black smoke that rose in a cloud.
The aviator had succeeded at great peril to himself
in dropping his bomb directly on the tank, with the
result that a large quantity of precious gasoline or
oil was lost to the enemy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Even as high up as the <em>Sea Eagle</em> chanced to be at
the time, those who were seated in the car could feel
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_214' id='Page_214'>214</a></span>
the wave of air concussion. The seaplane from which
the fatal bomb had been dropped was seen to rock
and plunge very much as a ship would in a gale at
sea; but the navigator who controlled the levers knew
his business, and managed to keep from turning turtle,
a fate that all aviators view with unpleasant sensations.</p>

<p class='c009'>Having accomplished his part of the raid, and
earned the commendation of his superiors, the gallant
airman began to climb the spiral staircase again,
seeking a safer altitude. If all the others could do
one-half as well as he had this raid would not soon
be forgotten by the defenders of Zeebrugge.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not a single Taube have we seen since starting
out!” said Pudge.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, can you blame them for keeping under
cover?” demanded Billy. “What could they do against
thirty big seaplanes such as we’ve got with us? A
rain of bombs would be the portion of any German
pilot rash enough to put up a fight. He’d be courting
sure death if he as much as showed his head.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In the beginning of the war the Germans were far
superior to either the British or the French with their
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_215' id='Page_215'>215</a></span>
aircraft. Their Taubes and Zeppelins caused much
alarm in many a French and Belgian city as they flew
over and dropped destructive bombs in the endeavor
to terrorize the enemy.</p>

<p class='c009'>That time, however, had gone by, and the assembling
of this fleet of big British seaplanes was a
plain notice to the Kaiser that the day of his supremacy
of the air had passed into other hands, and
that henceforth his aviators were to find themselves
outclassed for daring and skill.</p>

<p class='c009'>Around and around the hostile planes circled, each
spitting out from time to time a fresh supply of deadly
missiles that rained destruction on the military works
below. Of course, it would presently come to an end.
Then the wonderful fleet, having exhausted their supply
of ammunition, would take up the return journey,
leaving to the defenders of Zeebrugge the unpleasant
task of counting up their great losses, and trying to
conceal much of the truth, as all sides invariably do
under similar conditions.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank was anticipating seeing some signal flying
from the chief seaplane, a sort of “cease firing” order.
It was just at this time that Billy discovered
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_216' id='Page_216'>216</a></span>
another exciting event being enacted, and called the
attention of his companions to the fact.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve been watching that chap trying to hit that
magazine for some time,” he called out. “He seems
to be in hard luck, and now he’s going down like the
other one did to tackle the thing at closer quarters. I
only hope he gets through as well as the first one did.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, there hasn’t been a single accident worth
mentioning so far,” declared Pudge. “I’d hate to
see him dropped like a stone. Rafts and rattlesnakes,
but listen to the row they’re keeping up. They just
seem to know what he’s trying to do. Look at them
running away from that magazine like rats deserting
a sinking ship.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Swooping down, the Allies’ aviator was seen to
head almost directly over the object of his particular
attention. Calmly he measured the distance with his
practiced eye, while the pilot slowed the seaplane down
to a moderate speed.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic004'>
<a href='images/i3f.jpg'><img src='images/i3.jpg' alt='' class='ig004' /></a>
<p>The magazine was seen to fly to a million pieces, while up rose a vast cloud of smoke.—<i>Page</i> <a href='#Page_217'>217</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_217' id='Page_217'>217</a></span>
They were in a perfect storm of bursting shrapnel,
and at times the smoke fairly concealed the moving
machine. Once Pudge gave a low cry of dismay, for
he thought he had seen the seaplane plunging earthward
a wreck, when there would be no question about
the fate of its venturesome occupants.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he took fresh heart as a puff of air blew the
white and gray smoke aside, and it was discovered
that the aëroplane was still afloat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! why doesn’t he do it?” cried Pudge. “It
seems as if my heart would climb up in my throat,
I’m that worried. Throw now! There, he’s going
to do it, boys, don’t you see? I wonder if that shot
will be any better——”</p>

<p class='c009'>Pudge did not finish his sentence, for just then
there was a frightful roaring sound. The magazine
was seen to fly to a million pieces, while up rose a
vast cloud of smoke. The atmosphere was made to
fairly quake under the tremendous concussion, so that
Pudge clutched hold of Billy, who was alongside, as
though he actually feared they would be overturned
and hurled into space.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank’s heart also seemed to stand still, but it was
not on account of any fear for himself. When
through the rising billow of black smoke he saw that
the daring author of this last blow at the invader’s
army was apparently uninjured, Frank breathed freely
again.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_218' id='Page_218'>218</a></span>
  <h2 id='chXX' class='c010'>CHAPTER XX.<br /> <br />CAUGHT IN A SNOW SQUALL.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! they did it after all!” Pudge cried out as
they saw the reckless British birdmen in the seaplane
start to run the gantlet of gunfire preparatory to
rising once more to a safe height.</p>

<p class='c009'>That was about the feeling of relief that seized
upon them all. The deed had been so wonderfully
daring that Frank and his two chums would have
cheered its successful culmination no matter whether
a Frenchman, a Britisher or a German had piloted the
aircraft that carried it out—it was the <em>men</em> they
applauded, not their nationality.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How long is this terrible bombardment going to
keep up, do you think, Frank?” asked Billy, for it
seemed to him he had been gazing on the astounding
picture for an hour, so many things had followed fast
on each other’s heels.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I expect that was the crowning stroke,” replied
Frank, making himself heard only with some
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_219' id='Page_219'>219</a></span>
difficulty, owing to the clamor all around them from
bursting shrapnel, accompanied by the duller sounds
coming up from the distant earth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then the aviators are getting low in their stock
of ammunition,” affirmed the observant Billy, “because
I can see lots of things they’d still like to
smash.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Most of them have already stopped throwing
bombs,” Pudge declared. “That looks as if they’d
reached the end of their resources.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” added Frank, “there goes a signal from the
chief, and it must mean the time has come to start
on the return journey.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Even the seaplane that had undertaken the perilous
task of dropping down so as to make a sure job of
blowing up the magazine had by now managed to
climb to the level of the other fliers. A general movement
was noticed, heading toward the south, and
which must have been observed with great satisfaction
by the sadly harassed defenders of Zeebrugge,
who could now proceed to count up damages.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s been a wonderful trip for us,” remarked Billy,
as they again soared above the fleet, and kept up
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_220' id='Page_220'>220</a></span>
“without half trying,” as he himself would have said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The greatest thing about it, according to my
mind!” Pudge declared, “is that not a single plane
was brought down with all that firing. Why, even
up where we were I heard a queer singing noise several
times, that must have been made by parts of the
bursting shrapnel shells. They’re filled chock full of
bullets and all that sort of thing, I understand. How
about that, Frank?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” the pilot told him, “as far as I know what
is called shrapnel to-day is pretty much the same as
grape and canister used to be in the time of our
Civil War. It scatters in every direction, but is driven
now by a much more powerful explosive than in the
old days when gunpowder alone was used.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now that you mention it, Pudge,” said Billy, “I
heard some of those whining noises myself. It must
have been our swift movements that kept us from
being struck; and that’s what makes it so hard for
ground guns to fetch an aëroplane down.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” Frank continued, “anyone who has tried
to stop a duck speeding past at the rate of seventy
miles an hour knows what small chances he has to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_221' id='Page_221'>221</a></span>
wing the quacker. It takes nice judgment and a quick
eye to do it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So our excursion with the air raiders is all over,
is it?” Billy asked, with a tinge of regret in his tone;
for being engaged in the building of aëroplanes he
naturally took the keenest interest in seeing such a
fleet of the aircraft in action.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was thinking of making a proposition to M. Le
Grande here,” ventured Frank, without, however, taking
his attention from his levers.</p>

<p class='c009'>The experienced French aviator had been observing
everything that occurred with almost breathless
interest. He had clapped his hands enthusiastically
and cried “bravo! bravo!” when the bold British birdmen
made that death dip, and succeeded in blowing
up the magazine, taking terrible risks of perishing
themselves when the air waves caused their machine
to dance madly.</p>

<p class='c009'>At hearing Frank say this he showed a keen interest
in the possibility of something new developing
that had not been on the program.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should be pleased to hear what it is, young
m’sieu,” he now hastened to say.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_222' id='Page_222'>222</a></span>
“Since the raid is over with,” Frank commenced,
“and the fleet bound for Dunkirk and Calais, where
we understand the tired pilots will rest a few days
before returning across the Channel, how would you
like to have me take you out over the battle lines as
we saw them yesterday?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Pudge showed uncommon interest immediately. He
had heard so much about the astonishing sights witnessed
on that occasion by his two chums that it would
always be a source of bitter regret to him should
he have no opportunity to see the war picture for
himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Frenchman did not let a second go by, such
was his eagerness to accept the proposition advanced
by Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is charming of you, I must say, young
m’sieu,” he declared enthusiastically. “If you would
be so kind it would place me under heavy obligations.
To see how your wonderful <em>Sea Eagle</em> can
act under new and novel conditions would complete
my day, the most memorable of all my experiences,
and they have been many, I assure you, messieurs.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then there is really no need of our going down
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_223' id='Page_223'>223</a></span>
the coast any further,” Frank explained. “We might
as well make a sharp turn to the east here, and say
good-by to our gallant companions.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As they did this, the action was noted by many of
the speeding airmen; and while they could only guess
at the object of the change, this did not interfere
with their calling out and waving to the boys.</p>

<p class='c009'>Looking back, Billy and Pudge could see the flock
growing smaller in the distance as they scurried along
like a covey of partridges. Well had they done their
duty for the homeland on that day, and their hearts
were beating proudly as they could see, in imagination,
their names on the Roll of Honor for Britain’s
sons.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Billy and Pudge tried to forget all about the
late raid, for they knew they would have plenty of
excitement to the square inch with what lay before
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Just below where they broke away from the fleet
of birdmen lay Ostend, basking in the February sunshine.
It may have been fairly comfortable down
there, but it was pretty cold half a mile up in the air,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_224' id='Page_224'>224</a></span>
and the boys had reason to be thankful for their warm
clothing and head hoods.</p>

<p class='c009'>Attention was now called to the land over which
they had commenced to fly, leaving the coast line
behind. The Frenchman and Pudge in particular
were observing everything with undisguised eagerness.
While the experienced aviator had doubtless
taken many a trip himself over just such a landscape,
the conditions had never been just the same as they
were now. As for Pudge, this was his baptism of fire
in a seaplane, and as far as he had gone he rather
liked it.</p>

<p class='c009'>The great checkerboard lay below them. A hundred
different phases of the landscape engaged their
attention. They could see villages, towns, railway
lines, and even fortifications that may have been
erected by the German invaders in order to defend
some monster gun that was aimed seaward, so as to
give trouble to men-o’-war passing along the Belgian
coast.</p>

<p class='c009'>Billy and Pudge kept up a running fire of comment.
Dozens of things were constantly attracting
attention which had to be pointed out. Frank was
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_225' id='Page_225'>225</a></span>
not trying to make any great speed since there was
no need of haste.</p>

<p class='c009'>When they felt that they had gone far enough, and
the spirit moved them, he changed the course, and
they once more struck for Dunkirk on the French
coast.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No Taubes in sight yet, I notice?” Billy cried
out gleefully; for he remembered how those German
aëroplanes had risen like a swarm of angry hornets
on the occasion of their previous visit.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The news of the great raid must have been wired
all over the country before now,” Frank explained.
“Orders may have been given to keep all their Zeppelins
and other aircraft housed until the danger is
over.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can you blame them?” laughed Billy. “They
heard that as many as fifty seaplanes—for things are
always stretched, you know, in the telling—were chasing
up and down their coast, smashing everything to
pieces. They therefore would wait and then raid the
Allies’ quarters with a vengeance.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” added Pudge, “and right now I warrant
you many a pair of field glasses is turned up this
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_226' id='Page_226'>226</a></span>
way, and all sorts of guesses are made about what
sort of queer craft is whizzing over them. If your
Government gets this seaplane, Mister Le Grande,
and makes a bunch of them from the sample, you’ll
give the enemy cold feet right away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is a wonderful machine, I am ready to declare;
superb, beyond anything that I had ever dreamed
could be made. I have only praise, I assure you,”
was what the Frenchman told them in his explosive
way.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I guess that settles the business then,” remarked
Pudge to Billy, meaning that the report made by the
aviator must convince the French Government it was
greatly to their interest to conclude the bargain with
the <em>Sea Eagle Company, Ltd.</em>, as originally entered
into, for the delivery of this sample seaplane, and the
privilege of making as many others, on royalty, as
they chose within a given time.</p>

<p class='c009'>This would be the only way of settling the matter,
since no machines could be shipped from America
without a breach of neutrality, as the Government
at Washington had recently declared.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sea had now been left far behind, and Frank
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_227' id='Page_227'>227</a></span>
was veering their course somewhat toward the southeast,
as though he meant to cover a different field
from the first land journey.</p>

<p class='c009'>Billy noticed this, and asked questions in order to
settle matters in his own mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I reckon now, Frank,” he began, “you’ve got some
plan up your sleeve to make a wide circuit and see
something of what’s going on down along the border
of France? How about it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’re covering a strip of Belgium right now,”
said the pilot, “and you can see the unfinished canal
used by the Kaiser’s troops as trenches, besides all
sorts of other sights where the water has flooded the
lowlands when the dikes were cut in the fall by the
Belgians. Now we might like to take a peep at Lille,
and see what is going on in a different kind of country—where
there are hills and valleys.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That would be fine!” exclaimed Pudge, thinking
only of the wonderful pictures that would be spread
out beneath them as they sailed over just below the
occasional fleecy clouds.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course it would be more dangerous work,”
Frank hastened to tell them.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_228' id='Page_228'>228</a></span>
“You mean we would be shot at by batteries on
the hilltops, don’t you, Frank?” Billy questioned.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Partly that,” he was told, “and also from the
treacherous cross-currents of air we would be apt to
strike in such a hilly country. You never know when
you may hit an air pocket, a vacuum in which danger
lies for the aëroplane that is loafing, since it is apt
to drop like a plummet. But we’ll have to risk all
those things. If we come through all right, we’ll
consider that we were well rewarded.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here’s another of those nasty snow squalls heading
this way, Frank!” burst out Pudge. “That makes
the sixth we’ve struck. Say, let me tell you this
one looks like business, too, it spreads out so wide.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Isn’t there any way to avoid it, Frank—by climbing
up higher, for instance?” demanded Billy, as he
drew his hood closer around his cheeks, and made
ready to “take his medicine,” as he called it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Too late to try that now,” Frank told him. “All
we can do is to hold tight, and keep pressing straight
along. We’ll hope it isn’t so very big a cloud. Steady
now, everybody!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do your prettiest, old <em>Sea Eagle</em>,” Pudge was heard
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_229' id='Page_229'>229</a></span>
to call out as the beginning of the snow squall struck
them. Ten seconds later they were shrouded as in
a white pall by the scurrying flakes, urged on by a
wind that made the seaplane rock and dance in alarming
manner.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_230' id='Page_230'>230</a></span>
  <h2 id='chXXI' class='c010'>CHAPTER XXI.<br /> <br />A STARTLING DISCOVERY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It quickly became apparent that the squalls they
had previously met were playful little things compared
with this one. It buffeted the big seaplane
about as though determined to wind up its successful
career then and there; and only for the complete mastery
which Frank showed over the flier, some terrible
accident must surely have ensued.</p>

<p class='c009'>M. Le Grande was plainly nervous. He realized
that in this sort of a wild storm an ordinary aëroplane
would not have a ghost of a show. He was also
at first inclined to doubt the capacity of the American
boy aviator for meeting the strain of the situation.</p>

<p class='c009'>As he watched Frank manage, however, this doubt
took wings. He even began to take note of the astonishing
stability of the <em>Sea Eagle</em>, and decide in his
own mind that its like had never before been constructed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile Billy and Pudge were virtually “on
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_231' id='Page_231'>231</a></span>
needles and pins.” They had all kinds of confidence
in Frank, and faith in the big plane as well; but that
wind did shake things up terribly, and there could
be no telling how much worse the conditions ahead of
them might prove to be.</p>

<p class='c009'>None of them could see three feet in any direction.
Blinded by the swiftly driven snow pellets, that stung
as they came in contact with their faces, they were
compelled to bow their heads to the blast, and pity
Frank who was forced to stand it without flinching.</p>

<p class='c009'>Fortunately it did not last very long. Human endurance
would have been exhausted had it continued
indefinitely, for Frank was becoming more or less
weak under the strain, when he heard the experienced
French aviator shout in his ear:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Courage, it is passing by! I can see the sunlight
beyond. Courage, my brave boy! You have done
magnificently, superbly! I take off my hat to you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Yes, they could all see now that the snow was
growing lighter, showing the border of the cloud
must have been reached. Frank had urged the seaplane
on in a headlong rush with the idea of ending
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_232' id='Page_232'>232</a></span>
the agony sooner, and it was well he had shown such
sagacity.</p>

<p class='c009'>They emerged from the cloud which was soon left
far astern. Frank cut down the speed to one-half,
for the air was fearfully cold, and all of them seemed
to be very nearly frozen.</p>

<p class='c009'>Once in the bright sunshine again, though there
was very little of warmth to it, those who could do
so began to slap their arms violently to and fro in
the effort to induce circulation. The French air voyager
even relieved Frank from his arduous duties as
well as possible, so that he could get some life in his
stiffened fingers.</p>

<p class='c009'>M. Le Grande was fairly bubbling over with praise,
not only for the splendid way in which Frank had
managed his craft, but in regard to the seaplane itself.
Never, he told them, had he seen such a supremely
satisfactory test made to prove the stability
of a flier; and in every particular had the <em>Sea Eagle</em>
proven itself worthy of the highest praise.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! M’sieu!” he went on to say warmly, “with a
fleet of such wonderful craft, patterned after this
type, we French could soon end the war alone and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_233' id='Page_233'>233</a></span>
unaided, by striking terror to the heart of Berlin.
I am pleased beyond measure with all I have experienced.
The man whose mind conceived this wonder
of the air is indeed a wizard.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good for you!” cried Pudge, who naturally was
delighted to hear his father spoken of so highly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Once again they began to take an interest in what
they could see far below them. New and varied
sights were constantly cropping up as they journeyed
on. The character of the country was gradually
changing, too, for the dreary stretches of water that
marked the inundated lowlands of Belgium near the
coast began to merge into dry land. This was high
enough to have shed the rains that had been falling
during the better part of the winter now drawing to
a close.</p>

<p class='c009'>As before, Pudge and Billy commenced calling each
other’s attention to different things that caught their
eyes. These were all of an intensely interesting nature
and extremely varied.</p>

<p class='c009'>In numerous instances they were fired at. The
faint report of volleys came to their ears as soldiers,
in the hope of doing some damage, started shooting,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_234' id='Page_234'>234</a></span>
though it must be an extraordinary rifle that could
push a leaden missile that far up into the air.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now and then some anti-aircraft gun perched on
an elevation would take a shot at them, but the white
puff of shrapnel smoke invariably appeared far below,
and told that there was no danger from this
source at present.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It may be a different thing,” said Frank, when
they started discussing this failure of the shots to
reach their altitude, “when we strike a rough country,
for from the summit of a high hill one of those
guns could give us trouble.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, we must climb out of the danger zone
then, that’s all,” concluded Billy, as though not worrying
himself in the least about such a possibility.</p>

<p class='c009'>They were now approaching the fighting line that
stretched across the country in a zigzag fashion.
Everywhere the Germans had dug themselves in as
though it was their full intention to grimly hold on
to what they had seized, and only allow the Allies
to take it after the most desperate resistance.</p>

<p class='c009'>Eagerly the French aviator was using his binoculars.
No doubt he was making a mental map of many
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_235' id='Page_235'>235</a></span>
things they saw, and would not hesitate to use his
knowledge afterward, if he thought it might benefit
his side.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank winced a little as he thought of that, for he
did not wish to be unfair any more than conditions
imposed on him. He salved his conscience by telling
himself that there was nothing they were observing
but what any daring aviator of the Allies might
not ascertain for himself by a flight across that section
of the disputed territory of France.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If I saw a German Taube man in trouble right
now,” Frank was saying to himself, “I’d be just as
quick to go to his rescue as though it were a Frenchman
or a British pilot; and that’s what we mean by
calling ourselves neutral. I warrant you that ninety-nine
out of every hundred adults in the United States,
who know about this war, have a leaning toward one
side or the other, according from where their ancestors
came. But we all wish it was over, and Peace
had come again to these countries of Europe.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There had really been little to proclaim the fact
from radical changes in the villages below them, but
Frank believed they must have left the Belgian border
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_236' id='Page_236'>236</a></span>
behind, and were now sailing over Northern France.</p>

<p class='c009'>On mentioning this to M. Le Grande, he was immediately
assured by the French aviator that such
was indeed the case, and that though German fortifications
still dotted the landscape below, it was the
sacred soil of La Belle France.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Soon will they have to pack up their baggage
and set out for the Rhine country, when, in the Spring,
the great offensive begins,” the patriotic Frenchman
declared, as though the sight of those enemies encamped
on the soil of his beloved land filled his
heart with anguish.</p>

<p class='c009'>It seemed as though there was more or less action
going on all along the lines of trenches. As those
who sped along high above the earth watched, they
saw bodies of men shoot forward, to meet with a
deadly fire from all manner of concealed guns. Perhaps
they would be thrust back whence they sprang;
or if the impetus of their advance were sufficient to
carry them to the trenches of the enemy, there would
ensue a hand-to-hand grapple that was terribly fascinating.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pudge had to actually pinch himself several times
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_237' id='Page_237'>237</a></span>
in order to make sure he was awake, and not
dreaming.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To think that I’d ever have this wonderful chance
to see what modern warfare is like!” he exclaimed in
an awe-struck tone. “There’s the whole picture spread
out below as if it might be painted especially for our
benefit. Oh! what was that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>A terrible explosion had apparently taken place.
A section of the German trenches must have been
blown up with a mine, for in the midst of the smoke
they could see the khaki-clad British soldiers rushing
pell-mell to occupy the breach before the Kaiser’s
forces could recover from the shock, and hurry additional
forces up to hold the particular spot.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such things as that were happening here and there
along a line hundreds of miles in extent. It was
appalling to the boys to think of such a thing, having
so recently come from across the sea, where their
native land was basking under the sun of peace, with
not an enemy to fear.</p>

<p class='c009'>The country became more rugged as they pushed
on. Still there was no sign of any hostile aëroplane
rising to engage or trouble them. In fact, all that
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_238' id='Page_238'>238</a></span>
day up to now they could not remember having once
set eyes on a Taube or a Zeppelin in the air. It certainly
looked as though for once they must have had
strict orders to keep in hiding until the storm had
blown itself out.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can see what looks like a city away off yonder,”
announced Billy, who was handling the glasses again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is poor Lille, so long held possession of by
the barbarians,” said the native aviator, with sadness
in his tones; and the boys did not wonder at
it when later on they learned to their surprise that
M. Le Grande himself had been born and passed
most of his life in that city of Northern France.</p>

<p class='c009'>No doubt, if he could have had his way, he would
have enjoyed nothing better than the chance to hurl
down such a rain of bombs upon the invaders as must
have hastened them back to their own country.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you pass over Lille, Frank?” asked Billy,
and there was that in his voice to tell how pleased he
would be should his chum give a favorable answer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It would be something to say we had done it,”
Pudge hastened to remark, showing the trend of his
thoughts.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_239' id='Page_239'>239</a></span>
“Yes, we might as well take a look in, and see what
the Germans are doing there,” Frank announced.
“After which, with a swing around, we can set sail
for the fighting line, pass over to ground which the
British are holding, and then start for the coast at
Dunkirk, and so complete the roundabout cruise.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The seaplane passenger was staring at his native
city through his glasses, muttering to himself in
French. They could easily give a guess that these
were far from blessings he was calling down on the
heads of the Germans, who held on to everything
they ran across so obstinately.</p>

<p class='c009'>They were again made a target for numerous guns,
but as Frank had risen to a somewhat higher level,
they did not believe there was any chance of a stray
missile doing any damage.</p>

<p class='c009'>So they passed over Lille, and left the sorely
stricken city behind them. M. Le Grande twisted
himself halfway around, the better to see the last
of the place where his heart lay.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was just at this minute that Frank was heard
to utter a cry, and manifest considerable consternation.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_240' id='Page_240'>240</a></span>
“What’s happened?” cried Billy, as quick as a flash;
Pudge turned pale and glued his eyes on Frank’s
face, which was to him a barometer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s a slackening up in the feed as though the
pipe might be clogged!” exclaimed Frank, in considerable
apprehension. “Billy, take a look and see about
the amount of petrol we’ve got in the tank!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Billy knew how to go about this; indeed, it was
a part of his regular business.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had hardly started to carry out Frank’s instructions
before he shouted:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gee whiz! Frank, it’s just about plumb empty!
We must have been hit, and the tank’s sprung a leak!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ganders and gridirons!” cried Pudge in sheer dismay.
“Whatever will happen to us now, if we’re
forced to land in the midst of the whole German
army! Whee! I see our finish!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_241' id='Page_241'>241</a></span>
  <h2 id='chXXII' class='c010'>CHAPTER XXII.<br /> <br />THE NARROW ESCAPE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“It has been a leak, for even now it is dripping
down!” exclaimed the French aviator, pointing his
finger at the bottom of the petrol tank.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pudge and Billy held their breath. Everything
would depend on Frank, who must know what was
best to do. They might plane downward, and manage
to make some sort of a landing, but that would mean
capture by the enemy. The presence of the French
aviator would bring the wrath of the Germans down
on the heads of the boys, and as a result they would
be made prisoners of war.</p>

<p class='c009'>Not only that must follow, but the precious seaplane
would fall into the hands of the Kaiser’s men.
Such a possibility could never be endured. M. Le
Grande would be ready to try something desperate
before such a catastrophe could be countenanced.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank had to do some pretty swift thinking. Fortunately
he was not the one to lose his head in the
presence of unexpected danger.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_242' id='Page_242'>242</a></span>
“We must make a furious attempt to get across
the fighting line, which is some miles away from here
at La Basse!” he exclaimed. “When we descend, it
will be in the rear of the British forces, where we
can be safe!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let her go, Frank!” said Billy excitedly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, for all she’s worth!” added poor Pudge, as
well as he could, for his trembling lips made any
sort of utterance difficult.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank had not waited for this to turn on all power.
At the time of the discovery, with regard to the loss
of their precious liquid fuel, the seaplane had been
headed just right, so all that appeared necessary was
increased motion.</p>

<p class='c009'>The motors responded to the call upon their reserve
powers. Again, with muffler cut-out wide open, and
the green fire issuing from the exhausts amidst a
roaring sound, they rushed through space.</p>

<p class='c009'>What speed they were making none of them
thought to notice by glancing at the aërial speed meter,
but it must have been something like ninety miles
an hour at the very least, possibly much more.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here was another supreme test which the French
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_243' id='Page_243'>243</a></span>
aviator must be sure and take note of. He did not
show any particular signs of alarm, though he was
plainly excited.</p>

<p class='c009'>Everyone was gazing ahead, their only aim being
that they speedily arrive at the line where the gray-clad
Germans were standing off the khaki-clothed
soldiers of King George.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such was the state of their nerves, that seconds
seemed to drag like minutes. Billy was trying the
best he could to focus his glasses so as to announce
the glad tidings that they were rapidly nearing their
goal; but he found it hard work because of the shaking
of the seaplane under the forced pressure.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s there just ahead of us, Frank!” he finally
shouted. “Keep her going only a little while longer,
and we’ll be all right!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hurrah!” cried Pudge, rather feebly it must be
confessed, for the wind fairly took his breath away.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank had not only kept straight on but at the
same time he was commencing to head downward.
There was a strong possibility that at any second
the motors might refuse to work, being deprived of
their feed, and in consequence the big seaplane would
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_244' id='Page_244'>244</a></span>
have to start earthward by the method popularly
known as volplaning.</p>

<p class='c009'>When reduced to that method of landing, Frank
wanted to be as well down as he could with safety allow
the seaplane to drop. What little danger they
risked of being struck by some shot sent by the astonished
Germans was not worth while considering.
The great speed they were making would in itself
serve to protect them from this threatening evil.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a critical moment for the aëroplane boys,
and one that none of them would be likely to forget
soon. They could notice that the rattle of the exhaust
was growing more and more deadened. That
told them the end was very near and then the last
feeble effort of the motors would end in a total collapse.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A pint of gasoline would see us through with
flying colors!” exclaimed Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just to think of it,” cried Pudge dismally, as
though the thought of falling into the hands of the
Germans and being treated as a prisoner of war filled
his heart with dismay.</p>

<p class='c009'>“On! on! keep her going, young m’sieu!” almost
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_245' id='Page_245'>245</a></span>
shrieked the Frenchman, as he half stood up in his
great excitement, and turned his gaze from Frank
to the prospect before them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank had changed his plan of action. He no
longer pushed the motors to their utmost. The muffler,
too, now shut off those spiteful looking greenish
flames, and the rattle was silenced.</p>

<p class='c009'>In truth, Frank, in the belief that if they could
only keep afloat, their momentum would be sufficient
to carry the seaplane across the line of trenches, was
trying to conserve every atom of power. He asked
nothing more than this, and would be willing to take
his chances of making a fairly successful landing,
though a craft of that description was never intended
to start or finish a voyage save on the water.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pudge became more alarmed, now that the shrill
clatter of the exhaust had been silenced, for unlike
Billy he had not grasped just why this had come
about.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! will we make it, Frank?” he cried in an agony
of fear.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think so,” the pilot told him steadily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But she’s swaying right now as if ready to give
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_246' id='Page_246'>246</a></span>
up the ghost and drop!” Pudge complained in a
strained voice. “That rattle has stopped. Why is
that, Frank?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I did it so as to keep what energy we’ve got as
long as we can,” he was told.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’re doing nobly, young m’sieu!” called out M.
Le Grande.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, there are the trenches just ahead of us!”
added Billy. “Listen to the rattle of rifles, will you?
And I can hear cheers too, hearty English cheers.
See them jumping up in plain sight and waving to
us, boys! A little further, Frank, and you can volplane
if it’s necessary, because we’ll have crossed
the line and be in safety.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But the puttering of the motors told that they had
arrived at the last stage of labor. A gas engine cannot
run without fuel of some sort, and the vapor
now being fed was of an inferior quality, so that the
energy became less and less.</p>

<p class='c009'>They were at this critical time almost directly over
the German trenches, and so close that they could
see the soldiers pointing up at them, even without
the use of field glasses or binoculars.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_247' id='Page_247'>247</a></span>
“Oh! did you hear that bullet hum past then?”
ejaculated Pudge, who had ducked his head in an
involuntary way as though he would avoid contact
with the random lead, just as some nervous people
start with each flash of lightning.</p>

<p class='c009'>Other missiles were also winging along through
space, showing that the seaplane, in its mad race for
a safe landing, must have already descended a considerable
distance under Frank’s manipulation.</p>

<p class='c009'>Strange what queer thoughts will flash into the
mind when under such a stress as this. Frank afterward
laughed to remember how he was determining
then and there, that if ever he had occasion to make
another aërial voyage above hostile armies, where
he might be subject to a bombardment, one of the
things he meant to see about before starting was that
he carried a bullet-proof petrol reservoir along with
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly the motors ceased working, as the supply
of gas came to an abrupt end. They were by
now over the British trenches, where the men were
shouting all kinds of hoarse salutes, though
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_248' id='Page_248'>248</a></span>
compelled to again hastily seek shelter in their pits, as
the Germans had opened fire on them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank had but one way open to him in order to
reach the ground. This was to volplane swiftly,
as he had many a time done after shutting off all
power, and when a certain distance from the earth,
by suddenly working his planes, cause the aircraft to
assume a horizontal position instead of a vertical one,
after which would come the straight drop.</p>

<p class='c009'>Just what sort of a jar must accompany the landing
would depend, in a great measure, on the distance
they were up at the time, and the skill shown by the
pilot in managing these things.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is always deemed a spectacular method of descending
from an upper level, and not as dangerous
as it may appear to those who are unfamiliar with
the working of aircraft. Frank had practiced it
many a time, and in an ordinary aëroplane, with its
rubber-tired wheels to run along the ground, would
have thought nothing of it. When he had to land
with a seaplane, never meant for such a purpose, it
was a “horse of another color,” and might be considered
a very ticklish job.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_249' id='Page_249'>249</a></span>
The ground seemed to be rushing up to meet them
as they fell. Pudge shrank back as though he could
already feel the terrible shock of the contact, should
they continue to make that swift downward progress.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Frank was ready to change the planes, and in
this manner alter the conditions. They would act
as a stay, and bring their headlong rush earthward
to an end. After that it would simply be a dead
weight drop, and perhaps not so hard as to smash
anything about the seaplane beyond repairing.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before Pudge had time to take another full breath
it was all over. They had swept down beyond a low
hill, on top of which stood one of the windmills so
often seen in Holland, Belgium and Northern France,
with its broad arms standing motionless, and the
tower showing signs of having been struck by more
than one solid shot during some tempestuous battle
for the rise.</p>

<p class='c009'>With slackening speed, the seaplane followed the
descent, and then came to almost a full stop at its
base. After that it dropped straight to the ground.</p>

<p class='c009'>The shock proved to be rather severe, and Pudge
was even jolted from his seat, falling in a heap close
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_250' id='Page_250'>250</a></span>
by. Frank jumped out and was immediately followed
by Billy and the French air pilot, all of them
perhaps considerably shaken, but apparently none the
worse for the rough experience.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank first of all sprang over to where Pudge was
wallowing. The fat boy sat up just as Frank reached
his side.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope you’re not hurt much, Pudge?” cried the
pilot of the <em>Sea Eagle</em>, as he hurriedly bent over to
assist his chum to gain his feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pudge started to feel himself all over. He ran his
hands along his fat sides, and then down each leg;
after which he proceeded to announce the result.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nope, don’t seem to have any serious contusions
or broken bones that I’ve been able to find. Guess
I’m all whole, Frank, as I hope the rest of you are.
But how about the poor old <em>Sea Eagle</em>; is she smashed
beyond repair, do you think, Frank?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I haven’t taken a look at her so far,” the other
told him. “What little damage may have been done
can be easily repaired, once we get her taken by wagon
to our hangar at Dunkirk.”</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_251' id='Page_251'>251</a></span>
“Good enough!” cried Pudge. “I was worrying
more over the seaplane than about myself, I do declare.
When we can get in touch with the commander
at this section of the British forces, we might be able
to commandeer some sort of wagon on which the
machine can be packed, after we’ve taken it to pieces,
and transported it to town. Our good friend, M’sieu
Le Grande can tell them the plane now belongs to
the French Government, and that a heap depends on
its being taken to Dunkirk.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As they reached the spot where the big seaplane
lay like a wounded bird, it was to see the Frenchman
and Billy come crawling out from under the wings.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s the extent of the damage?” asked Frank
immediately.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before Billy could start explaining, there was a
sharp sound heard, and Frank actually felt the wind
of a bullet whizzing past his cheek.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Duck down everybody!” he exclaimed, suiting his
actions to the words, and pulling Pudge after him.
“We’re being fired on by somebody concealed in that
old windmill base over there. Try and find shelter
if you can, Billy!”</p>

  <h2 id='chXXIII' class='c010'>CHAPTER XXIII.<br /> <br />THE WINDMILL FORT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>While Frank was calling out after this manner
everybody was making haste to show as little of their
person as possible. As there was not much shelter
of any kind available, the only way this could be accomplished
was to flatten out on the ground.</p>

<p class='c009'>By some species of good luck it happened that there
was a dip to the earth at the base of the low elevation
on which the windmill had been built. Frank
afterward called it a “swale.” It ran away from
the spot in a zigzag fashion, and perhaps if one were
agile and clever, he might even manage to wriggle
along this dip without exposing much of his person
to those in the tower.</p>

<p class='c009'>The four of them thus wallowed, and tried to exchange
remarks.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There goes another shot,” said Billy, as a report
came to their ears. “I hope nobody’s been hit so far.
How about that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_253' id='Page_253'>253</a></span>
“No damage here,” replied Frank immediately.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am pleased to say the same, young m’sieu,”
added the Frenchman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, so far I haven’t felt a wound, but I’m expecting
something dreadful to happen any minute
now,” Pudge called out ruefully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, what’s the matter with you, Pudge?” demanded
Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Only this, that I loom up so much more than
anybody else, and there’s lots of chances of them seeing
me, that’s all. But then a fellow can only die
once, and perhaps I won’t know what hits me, which
is some comfort.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hug the ground for all you’re worth then,” the
other told him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am, till I can hardly breathe,” replied Pudge.
“How long are we going to stay here do you think,
Frank?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not a great while, if we know it,” came the answer,
which proved that Frank, as usual, was already
figuring on some masterly move.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But think of the nerve of the Germans occupying
that windmill right back of the British lines, would
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_254' id='Page_254'>254</a></span>
you?” exclaimed Billy, as though that fact interested
him more than anything else.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, you can expect nearly anything in this desperate
fighting,” Frank told him. “Only the other
day I was reading about a case where they had made
a fort out of an old windmill that had a concrete
foundation and walls. The Allies tried ever so many
times to dislodge the German sharpshooters, but
couldn’t. Then the airmen took a hand, but failed
to drop a bomb where it would do the business.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How did they manage it in the end, Frank?” asked
Billy, always eager to hear the explanation of any
puzzle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“After they had lost a lot of men in direct assaults,
the Allies dug a tunnel up under the windmill, laid
a mine, and exploded it,” Frank continued.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And that did the business, did it?” questioned
Pudge, also deeply interested for personal reasons.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It shattered things, and killed every German in
the place,” said Frank. “Do you know they found
more than a dozen quick-firing guns there? They had
made it a regular fort, even though they knew not
a single man of them could ever escape in the end.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_255' id='Page_255'>255</a></span>
“But how can we dig a tunnel without the tools?”
demanded Pudge, almost pathetically, “and what have
we got to blow them up with, I want to know?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Billy laughed derisively.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We couldn’t if we would, Pudge,” he remarked,
“and we wouldn’t if we could. We came over here
on business for the <em>Sea Eagle Company, Limited</em>, and
not to take a hand in shortening the supply of the
Kaiser’s brave soldiers.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then what are we meaning to do about it?” the
fat boy kept on asking. “I want to know, because
to tell you the truth, I’m not feeling very comfortable
right now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Frank, have you thought up that scheme yet?”
asked Billy, just as indifferently as though it might
be the regular program for Frank to figure out a
method of escaping from each and every ill that beset
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think there’s a way to do it,” Frank responded.
“This swale we’re lying in, as near as I can tell, keeps
right along in a crooked fashion, but always bearing
in a direction that will take us away from the windmill.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_256' id='Page_256'>256</a></span>
“Oh! that’s the game, then, is it?” cried Billy.
“You lead off, and we follow after you like a trailing
snake? Well, I’m pretty good on the crawl, and when
it’s necessary I can wriggle to beat the band.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” sang out Pudge with a groan, “but how
about me? I’m not built to make a good wriggler,
and you know it, fellows. It’s going to be awful
tough on a fellow whose body is so thick that it looms
up above the sheltering bank some of the time. I’ll
be fairly riddled with shot, sooner or later. Please
tell me how I’m going to manage it, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s only one thing for you to do, Pudge,”
Billy jeered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s that?” asked the unhappy Pudge.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hug tight where you are, and we’ll promise to
come back sooner or later and rescue you, after we’ve
got a bunch of those Tommies to help us out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Apparently the “last resort” idea did not wholly
appeal to Pudge, for he quickly went on to say:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Guess I’ll do the best I can at hunching along
after you. Some places I might manage to roll, you
see. But I certainly do hope they won’t open fire
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_257' id='Page_257'>257</a></span>
on me with one of those machine guns that run off
a dozen shots a second.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank was already on the move. He may have
been sorely puzzled to account for this strange and
unprovoked attack on them by the unknown party
or parties concealed inside the base of the old windmill;
but he also knew that the only thing for them
to do was to get away from the danger zone.</p>

<p class='c009'>A third shot was heard just about that time, and
Pudge gave a groan, which naturally alarmed the
other boys.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t tell me you’ve been hit, Pudge?” called
Billy, whose heart was in the right place, even if he
did occasionally joke his stout chum when a rollicking
humor seized him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, not that I’m aware of,” came the answer,
“but every time I hear that gun go off it gives me
a fierce start. This thing is even worse than falling
in an aëroplane, and expecting to get smashed when
you strike the ground.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But we’re getting along, remember,” said Frank,
meaning to encourage the other.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And these bends on the dip help to hide us from
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_258' id='Page_258'>258</a></span>
those Germans back there in the bargain,” added Billy,
wishing to contribute his mite of consolation.</p>

<p class='c009'>The French aviator said nothing, though he too
must have realized that they were all in more or less
danger should they expose themselves too rashly. No
doubt, those enemies concealed back of the walls of
the windmill base were watching eagerly to catch
signs of their presence, and ready to send a storm of
deadly missiles that way at the least invitation.</p>

<p class='c009'>Despite his size, Pudge was really making a good
job out of it. He could do things when he made up
his mind to try hard.</p>

<p class='c009'>They could hear him puffing dreadfully, and making
a noise that Billy likened to the blowing of a porpoise
as it wallowed in the billows.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Every foot counts with us, remember, Pudge,”
said Billy, who was just ahead of the fat boy, turning
his head to speak, for it was hardly wise to call out
any longer and thus tell the enemy where to fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mine feel like they were made of lead and I can
hardly drag ’em along after me,” the other replied,
mistaking the meaning of Billy’s words.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_259' id='Page_259'>259</a></span>
“There goes still another shot; I wonder what they
can be shooting at?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hearing Billy make this remark, Frank saw fit to
answer him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think they must believe we’re still hiding somewhere
about the seaplane, which is partly visible from
the rise; and every now and then they take a snap
shot to let us know they’re on the job.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At hearing that Pudge seemed to feel much easier
in his mind, for there was a joyful strain to his voice
when he next spoke in a husky whisper to Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That lets me out, Billy, and I’ll be able to hunch
along better after this. But let me tell you I’ll be
mighty glad when it’s all over with. I’m scraping
my knees something awful, and I’ll be lame for days
after this.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, why complain when you know there are
some things a whole lot worse than having scraped
knees?” he was told. Apparently this caused Pudge
to look at things in a different light, for he closed up.</p>

<p class='c009'>It continued in this fashion for quite some time,
until Frank began to believe they had gone well beyond
the danger zone. When he raised his head he
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_260' id='Page_260'>260</a></span>
could not discover the windmill at all, which was
ample proof that there was no longer anything to fear
from that quarter.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was just about to say something along those
lines to the others, when he made an unpleasant discovery.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What are you stopping here for, Frank?” asked
Billy, as he and the French aviator came crawling
up alongside the leader, and he chanced to observe
that Frank was acting rather strangely.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because it seems that our further progress is going
to be blocked,” replied Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re staring hard at that bunch of trees ahead
where we were hoping to get on our feet again.
What’s wrong over yonder?” demanded Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Only that I’ve seen signs to tell me there are men
hiding in among those trees, who have seen us coming,
and are waiting to trap us,” Frank told him.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_261' id='Page_261'>261</a></span>
  <h2 id='chXXIV' class='c010'>CHAPTER XXIV.<br /> <br />FRIENDS IN NEED.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! something is always cropping up to nip our
plans in the bud, it seems like,” Pudge groaned, on
hearing Frank make that unpleasant statement.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you sure they’re Germans, Frank?” demanded
Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I couldn’t tell from the glimpses I had of them,”
answered the other; “only they have guns, and are
in uniform.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course, I had to go and leave the field glasses
hanging in the case with the seaplane,” Billy declared.
“M’sieu, would you mind letting me look through
those binoculars you have along with you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Of course, the obliging Frenchman immediately
complied with this request, and as Billy focused the
glasses on the trees ahead the others held their breath
while waiting to hear the verdict.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There, I can see figures, all right,” said the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_262' id='Page_262'>262</a></span>
observer, “and they’re watching this way in the bargain.
Frank, it’s all right, I tell you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then they’re British soldiers?” asked the other,
with a note of relief in his voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just what they are,” replied Billy. “They must
have seen the plane falling back here, and have come
to find out whether anyone was hurt. Then those
shots over at the old windmill made them hold up,
and right now they don’t know what to think. Hadn’t
you better signal them, Frank?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Right away, Billy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Accordingly Frank elevated his handkerchief, and
waved it until he received a reassuring signal from
someone amidst the trees. After that the little party
rose and advanced, Frank advising them to hold up
their hands so as to convince the soldiers they had no
possible hostile intent.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was with a feeling of great relief that they found
themselves face to face with a British captain, who
surveyed them curiously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You came down in that big aëroplane with the
boat underneath it?” was the first thing he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, and we count ourselves pretty lucky not to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_263' id='Page_263'>263</a></span>
have dropped inside the German lines in the bargain,”
Frank told him. “You see, sir, we are three American
boys. My name is Frank Chester, this is Billy
Barnes, a newspaper reporter, and Pudge Perkins is
the third member of our party. As for this gentleman,
you must surely have heard of the well-known
French aviator, M. Armand Le Grande.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And I am Captain Charles Marsden, of the Sussex
Regiment,” replied the officer, cordially shaking
hands. “Most assuredly, I have often heard of M.
Le Grande, and once saw him play a daring trick
on three German Taube pilots. But what manner of
strange craft was it passed over our lines, and where
have you come from?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“First of all,” said Frank, “I had better explain
what brought the three of us over here in France
when we had better be safe at home in America. The
father of Pudge here is an aviator and an inventor.
He has constructed a wonderful seaplane designed to
save human life in case of accidents at sea. A sample
was sent over to the French Government at their
request before the war broke out, but had never been
taken from the cases. So, on their invitation, we came
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_264' id='Page_264'>264</a></span>
across to assemble the parts, and prove the great value
of the new type of machine.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All this is very interesting to me, my young
friend,” ventured the officer; “so please go on with
your explanations.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We have a contract whereby the French Government
can acquire this great seaplane for cash, and
pay a royalty for every one up to fifty that they construct
themselves from the sample. That is as far
as our neutrality will allow us to go. And M. Le
Grande was selected to accompany us on a trial flight
to learn in what way our <em>Sea Eagle</em> was superior to
the ordinary planes in common use.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! then you have just been making that flight,”
remarked the officer, “and by mistake managed to
cross the lines, so that you came near falling into
the hands of the enemy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank smiled, and even Pudge gave a disdainful
snort.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, although you have not heard the news yet,
Captain Marsden, this has been a glorious day for
your countrymen,” Frank told him. “This morning
some thirty-four seaplanes started up the coast, nearly
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_265' id='Page_265'>265</a></span>
every one of them manned by British aviators, and
made a most desperate raid on the submarine bases
around Zeebrugge, as well as bombarded railway stations,
destroyed oil tanks, and even exploded a magazine,
giving the enemy a grand scare, and doing much
damage.”</p>

<p class='c009'>How the officer’s rosy face broadened in a smile
when he heard that! The way in which the Kaiser
had spoken of them in the beginning of the war as
“that contemptible little British army,” would never
be forgotten or forgiven; and everyone who wore
the king’s khaki was resolved in his mind to do all
in his power to make the Emperor change his opinion
before quitting time.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But how do you know about this grand event?”
he demanded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We accompanied the raiders, and witnessed pretty
much all that was done,” Frank told him. “After
the fleet of aircraft had turned homeward again we
started across country to take a look at Lille, and see
what you people were up to over in this region. We
also meant that M’sieu should have the worth of his
money and learn all the big airship could do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_266' id='Page_266'>266</a></span>
“Wonderful, and you so young at that!” exclaimed
the soldier; “but then I understand American boys
are equal to such things. But what happened to send
you down as though you were a bird with a crippled
wing?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A stray shot must have punctured our petrol tank
and allowed the fuel to drain out, for we suddenly
discovered we had none. Only through great luck
were we able to push ahead, and escape falling back
of the German lines.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That would have been a misfortune in several
ways, I take it,” said the officer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just after we fell, and were trying to see if any
of us had been hurt, we were fired on from the old
windmill base, and it was only by crawling along
a depression that we finally managed to escape.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So that was where those shots came from?” cried
Captain Marsden. “We wondered if they had any
connection with the dropping of the aëroplane. What
do you wish us to do for you, boys?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Excuse me,” Frank remarked, “but hearing you
say you belonged to a Sussex regiment made me remember
that a very good friend of ours, in Dunkirk
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_267' id='Page_267'>267</a></span>
just at present, Major Nixon, also came from that
part of England.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What, Tom Nixon!” exclaimed the soldier, his
face lighting up again; “one of my best friends, and
with whom I’ve followed the hounds dozens of times
after the fox. If you are comrades of his, I would
esteem it a privilege to help you out in any way possible.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The chief concern we have,” Frank told him, “is
that we must manage in some way to get our machine,
after we’ve taken it to pieces, transported back to
the hangar at Dunkirk.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But suppose we could supply you with sufficient
petrol to take you there; would that help you out,
or is the machine wrecked too badly?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is injured somewhat,” Frank continued, “though
we might manage to repair that part of it; but unfortunately
it is next to impossible for a seaplane
to rise anywhere but from the water. That is on
account of the boat part of the structure, you understand,
sir. Could you manage to secure us a motor
truck to transport ourselves and the machine across
country by road? It would be doing the French
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_268' id='Page_268'>268</a></span>
Government one of the greatest favors possible; ask
M’sieu here if that is not so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed, there could not be a greater favor,” the
Frenchman declared warmly. “I have seen to-day
that which may help to bring this terrible war to a
much speedier close if only we can put fifty of those
wonderful American machines in the field.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say no more, for I shall see to it that the motor
truck is placed at your service,” said the captain
heartily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But how about the windmill, Captain?” asked
Frank, “and the Germans who occupy it as a fort;
will you attack them and capture the place? It commands
the spot where the stranded seaplane lies, and
I’m afraid we can do but little unless the danger is
laid.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We will go back the way you came,” decided the
soldier. “I will have my men accompany us, and
when we reach a convenient place a rush should take
the mill.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll go along with you then, Captain,” assented
Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Same here,” added Billy; but Pudge shook his
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_269' id='Page_269'>269</a></span>
head sadly, and reaching down felt tenderly of his
knees, as he remarked:</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ll have to excuse me this time, fellows; I
must beg off. After it’s all over give me a whoop,
and I’ll <em>walk</em> to where you are. Crawling doesn’t
seem to be my special forte, I’m sorry to say.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s all right, Pudge, stay here until we give
you the signal that the coast is clear,” Billy told him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Orders being given to the soldiers, the entire lot
started toward where the dip began. A few minutes
later they were making their way along on hands and
knees, and appearing to the observant Pudge very
much like a trailing snake.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was not a single shot fired at them as they
crept on, and in the end they found themselves at
the spot where the big seaplane lay.</p>

<p class='c009'>As they could go forward no further in that way,
orders were given for a charge, and the two boys,
still crouching there, were thrilled to see the dozen
men in khaki start across the open ground on the run,
each one dodging as he saw best in order to take as
little chances of being hit as possible.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, look at that, Frank!” cried Billy. “Not a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_270' id='Page_270'>270</a></span>
single shot has been fired at them! What do you
think the Germans are up to? Are they waiting to
mow them down in a heap? Hey, isn’t that a white
flag waving from the old mill? Why, honest, now, I
do believe they mean to throw up the sponge, and
surrender. Let’s start forward ourselves, Frank.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wait and see,” cautioned the other. “After the
soldiers have gone inside will be time enough for us
to hurry up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, there they go right now, Frank!” cried
the other. “Please come on, for I’m dying to know
what it all means. It isn’t like Germans to give up
that way without a hard fight.”</p>

<p class='c009'>When they arrived at the windmill the mystery was
soon explained. The terrible garrison consisted of
just a single old man, and he was not a German at
all, but a French peasant who had lost all he possessed
when the Kaiser’s army went through this part of
France earlier in the war. His mind had given way
under the strain, and filled with the idea that his old
mill was a fort he had stationed himself in it with
his gun, ready to repel the invaders of the sacred
French soil.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_271' id='Page_271'>271</a></span>
When the strange seaplane fell he had conceived the
idea that it was some sort of monster which he ought
to slay, and so he had taken several pot-shots at the
great drab wings which he could just see from his
lookout.</p>

<p class='c009'>Luckily, however, the old peasant, crazy though he
might be, knew British soldiers’ uniforms, for the
Tommies had been very good to him during the month
they were in the neighborhood pushing the enemy
back. So he had put up that white flag as soon as he
recognized the khaki uniforms of those who were
advancing on the run.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Shucks!” Billy was heard to say. “That’s the
way things sometimes drop from the sublime to the
ridiculous. Here we were picturing a squad of desperate
Prussians cooped up in this windmill base ready
to sell their lives dearly, and it proves to be a silly
old peasant who is out of his mind.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, it’s a tragedy, just the same,” Frank told
him. “Think of what this Jean Bart has suffered,
seeing all his possessions destroyed, and perhaps his
entire family wiped out. The Captain tells me there
was some trouble with the natives here when the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_272' id='Page_272'>272</a></span>
German army went through, and some reckless shooting.
But now we can get busy on the seaplane. Call our
chum Pudge, will you, Billy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The work of taking the seaplane to pieces was going
to take them some little time. Meanwhile Captain
Marsden, who left several of his men at the spot with
orders to assist where it was possible, went back to
headquarters to state the case and see what could be
done toward getting them a motor truck.</p>

<p class='c009'>As these vehicles were carrying loads to the front,
and usually went back empty, save when they took
some of the wounded to the hospitals, it did not prove
a very difficult thing to commandeer such a van, once
permission had been obtained from the general.</p>

<p class='c009'>Along about three in the afternoon of that February
day, they saw a big motor truck coming. It
seemed capable of passing over the fields as well as
the road, for at the time the ground was pretty well
frozen.</p>

<p class='c009'>Everything seemed favorable, and the work of
loading the seaplane was commenced with a vim.
Before they got off, Captain Marsden again made his
appearance, accompanied by a higher officer, who
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_273' id='Page_273'>273</a></span>
turned out to be the general in charge of that part
of the British line, though the boys were not told his
name.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had been so deeply impressed with the remarkable
story told by the captain that he had taken the
trouble to come out there himself to meet the bold
American boys who had that day witnessed the aërial
bombardment of the German naval bases along the
Belgian coast.</p>

<p class='c009'>While the loading was being finished, at his urgent
request, Frank entered into a brief description of
what they had seen the fleet of seaplanes accomplish.
His stirring account must have greatly pleased and
heartened the general, for he insisted on shaking
hands with Frank on leaving, an honor few dignified
British officers would be likely to bestow upon
boys from another land.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope we’re going to ride along with the machine,
Frank?” remarked Pudge, when the last knot
had been tied in the ropes that held the packed seaplane
on the van.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know what you’re meaning to do, Pudge,”
Billy told him. “I’ve got my seat all picked out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_274' id='Page_274'>274</a></span>
“Better get up, for we’re going to start,” warned
Frank; and so Pudge found a place where he would
not be in danger of rolling off. Frank followed suit,
Le Grande also got aboard, and then the big motor
truck started for the nearest road.</p>

<p class='c009'>Captain Marsden, having waved them a farewell,
was heard shouting after them:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Give my best regards to Tom Nixon, and tell him
we’ll follow the hounds again after this little unpleasantness
is over. Good-by, and good luck to you!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 id='chXXV' class='c010'>CHAPTER XXV.<br /> <br />THE DESPERATE GAME OF TAG.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Riding on that motor truck over some of the very
roads in that section of France where hot battles had
only recently been fought, that was another new experience
for the Boy Aviators. In many places the
driver of the van pointed out to them interesting features
of the landscape, relating to M. Le Grande the
fierce struggle that had perhaps taken place where
that barbed wire entanglement was seen, and then
showing where innumerable little mounds of earth
marked the last resting place of those brave men who
had laid down their lives for their country.</p>

<p class='c009'>They overtook several vans containing wounded
soldiers, who seemed very cheerful, and were actually
singing in chorus, as British Tommies have a habit
of doing. An ambulance squad was also encountered
going to the front for a fresh load, taking nurses and
doctors wearing the Red Cross on their sleeves to
where they would find plenty of work.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_276' id='Page_276'>276</a></span>
Pudge took a great interest in the hospital corps.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They’re the real heroes and heroines of this war,
as sure as anything,” he remarked, sagely, as he waved
his hand toward the party, and received an answering
signal from one of the buxom looking English lassies.</p>

<p class='c009'>There were times when for a short distance they had
the road apparently to themselves. Then again it
would be crowded with all manner of vehicles, and
marching troops heading toward the front, returning
wounded, and artillery being dragged laboriously
along, either with sturdy horses or powerful traction
engines.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys were feeling fairly decent, for the sun
had a little warmth in it, and there was even a hint
of coming Spring in the breath of the lowlands.</p>

<p class='c009'>Without the slightest warning there came a terrible
crash that seemed to make the earth tremble. Pudge
came within an ace of tumbling off the crowded van,
and was only saved by Billy clutching hold of him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! a German shell must have burst!” shrilled
the excited Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But we are too far away from the fighting line
for that,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_277' id='Page_277'>277</a></span>
A passing shadow made him look hastily upward.
As he did so a cry of wonder and dismay burst from
his lips, which of course caused everyone to follow
his example, even to the chauffeur of the war van.</p>

<p class='c009'>“An aëroplane!” shouted Pudge.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, and a German Taube at that, don’t you see?”
cried Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That must have been a bomb thrown at us, and
there over on the right is where it made a gap in the
field,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>The chauffeur looked somewhat alarmed. He even
increased the speed of the big van, though it was too
cumbersome a vehicle to move at all swiftly, its main
hold being vast power and carrying ability.</p>

<p class='c009'>The aëroplane was at some distance above them, and
moving in a circle like a great hawk which it so much
resembled.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Frank, he’s turning to come up behind us again,
don’t you see?” exclaimed Pudge, gripping the arm
of the one to whom this remark was addressed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sure thing,” added Billy, trying to look calm,
though he was trembling all over with the nervous
strain and the excitement of the thing; “he’s meaning
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_278' id='Page_278'>278</a></span>
to try again and see if this time he can’t make a better
crack at us, I suspect.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But why pick out this van when there are lots of
the same type moving along the road, going and coming,
that’s what I’d like to know?” begged the bewildered
Pudge.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Huh! guess you forget what we’re carrying with
us, don’t you, Pudge?” demanded Billy, with a sense
of importance in his voice and manner.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The <em>Sea Eagle</em> plane!” burst out the fat chum.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Haven’t the Germans been trying right along to
either get possession of our sample machine, or failing
that smash it into splinters, so the Allies can’t profit
by the same?” asked Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, yes, it must be as you say, Billy,” admitted
Pudge; “but see there, he’s swept around now, and
seems to be lowering with that big circle. Frank, will
he get us yet, do you think?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not if we are smarter than he is,” replied the
other, as with wrinkled brow he watched the evolutions
of the daring flier.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They learned that we’d met with that accident,”
Billy went on to say hurriedly, “and as soon as they
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_279' id='Page_279'>279</a></span>
could get one of their fliers busy it was started out to
look for the van carrying our seaplane. That chap
up there alongside the pilot has glasses, and spied us
out easy enough.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There, he’s heading after us again, Frank!”
shrilled Pudge, shivering as he stared, although it must
have been only with a great effort that the fat boy was
able to twist around as he did; “what can we do to
upset his calculations?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If one of those terrible bombs ever hits us, good-night!”
muttered Billy, as he too kept tabs of the now
approaching Taube.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank was saying something to the chauffeur, evidently
making certain arrangements with him so that
when he touched the man’s arm he would suddenly
shut off power, and bring the van to a full stop.</p>

<p class='c009'>They could easily see the two who were in the
Taube, the pilot paying attention to his part of the
business, while his companion leaned eagerly forward,
intently watching so as to hurl the bomb at the right
second.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank judged rightly that the man would make
allowances for the speed of the motor van along the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_280' id='Page_280'>280</a></span>
road, when he sent the explosive. That was where
their real chance to outwit the enemy lay.</p>

<p class='c009'>Keenly he watched this second man, forgetting
about the pilot, who really had little to do with the
hurling of the bomb.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There, he’s raising his hand, Frank!” cried Pudge.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And I can see what he’s gripping, too!” added
Billy vociferously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Keep still!” ordered Frank, who did not wish them
to be making any sort of racket while the crisis was
so close at hand, since it might interfere with what he
meant to do, and that was of vital importance to them
all.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank could judge for himself about when the man
was apt to throw his deadly missile. Their own speed
was only a certain per cent slower than that of the
hostile aëroplane above.</p>

<p class='c009'>Just when he discerned a movement of the man’s
whole body and knew he was in the act of speeding
the explosive, Frank gripped the arm of the waiting
chauffeur.</p>

<p class='c009'>Instantly the expectant driver shut off all power and
applied the brake. It was just as though he had
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_281' id='Page_281'>281</a></span>
suddenly found himself about to plunge through the open
draw of a bridge into a deep river.</p>

<p class='c009'>Even as the big clumsy van came to a halt in the
road there was a fearful crash not thirty feet ahead
of them, accompanied by a puff of smoke.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys had dropped back as flat as they could at
Frank’s suggestion, and fortunately no one seemed to
have been injured by the flying missiles and stones.</p>

<p class='c009'>Immediately the chauffeur once more started forward,
though of course he had to drive carefully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! see the fierce hole it dug in the road-bed!”
burst forth Billy, and they all stared hard at this positive
evidence of the dreadful result of the explosion.</p>

<p class='c009'>By judicious care the chauffeur managed to get
around the obstruction without having one of his
wheels sink into the gap. Of course the first squad
of men passing along that way would fill in the hole;
but the boys were certainly not bothering their heads
over that at present.</p>

<p class='c009'>They could see that the two daring aviators who
seemed so bent on accomplishing the utter annihilation
of the wonderful American invention, were not disheartened
so far by their several failures.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_282' id='Page_282'>282</a></span>
“They don’t mean to give it up at that, Frank, believe
me!” said Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! they’re a stubborn lot, those Germans,” admitted
Pudge, “and never know when to stop, once
they’ve set their minds on a thing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Third time may be the charm, you know,” croaked
Billy, hoarse from the excitement under which he was
undoubtedly laboring for all he appeared so cool.
“Don’t I wish I had my trusty gun along right now.
Mebbe I wouldn’t make those chaps sit up and take
notice, and quit their fooling.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They’re dropping still lower, Frank!” said Pudge.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I see they are,” answered the other, soberly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here’s a stick that might look like a gun from up
above,” said the artful Billy; “I’m going to lie down
and keep waving it like I was taking aim. It can’t do
any harm that I see, and may make them keep off
some, hey, Frank?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do as you please, Billy,” he was told.</p>

<p class='c009'>Truth to tell Frank was hard put to it just then to
know what their plan of campaign ought to be. The
next time the Germans hurled one of their bombs the
man in the speeding Taube would be apt to discount
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_283' id='Page_283'>283</a></span>
that sudden stoppage of the van, and try to drop his
explosive so that it might strike them as their momentum
ceased.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Slow up somewhat,” he told the chauffeur. “And
this time when I grip your arm put on every ounce of
speed you can give. We’ll change our tactics.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bully for you, Frank; a change of base is always a
good thing!” said Billy, already lying down and starting
to move his pretended gun around.</p>

<p class='c009'>Once again the aëroplane was directly behind them.
It was evidently a part of the scheme of their foes to
follow after them, trying to keep in the same general
course, so that the man who hurled the bomb would
only have to consider the proper second to let it go.</p>

<p class='c009'>They had also come down still lower, so that every
movement could be seen distinctly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Undoubtedly none of those boys would ever forget
the grim appearance of those airmen bending forward
to peer down at the fleeting motor truck on that road
in Northern France. There was a peculiar grimness
connected with their looks, togged out as they were in
their customary air cruising clothes, and with goggles
shielding their eyes that gave them a strange look.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_284' id='Page_284'>284</a></span>
Once again did Frank decide properly when the
man was in the act of hurling the bomb. His fingers
closed upon the arm of the van driver, who immediately
started the cumbersome vehicle to moving
forward as fast as the engine was capable of sending
it.</p>

<p class='c009'>A third crash made the air quiver, and brought out
a shout from the irrepressible Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Too slow that time, Hans!” he whooped, as he
continued to wave his make-believe gun; “knocked
another hole in the poor old road, that’s what. At
that rate they’ll have it all torn up between here and
Dunkirk.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will they give it up now, do you think, Frank?”
wheezed Pudge, who had made it a point to actually
hold his breath on each occasion just as though that
was going to be of any benefit to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t flatter yourself that way, Pudge,” Billy
hastened to say, taking it upon himself to answer;
“they’ll never quit as long as there’s a single shot in
the locker, believe me. We’ve just got to keep on
dodging the same the best we know how.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Next time they may come so low down that they
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_285' id='Page_285'>285</a></span>
just can’t miss,” complained the fat chum, disconsolately.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Huh! don’t you believe that, because they might
have seen me taking aim with my gun here, and airmen
don’t like to be peppered at close range. Chances
are they’ll swoop down and let fly, but no hovering
over us for them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank was busy trying to figure out what would be
the next move on the part of those grim pursuers, who
seemed so determined to accomplish the utter destruction
of the wonderful seaplane that placed in the hands
of the French was bound to be of material advantage
to the cause they had at heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>In doing this Frank tried to put himself in the place
of the other. He figured out just what sort of a feint
he would make in order to draw the fire of the van
driver. Whether the vehicle stopped, or shot forward,
he could then change his pace, and hurl the bomb.</p>

<p class='c009'>So Frank again gave his instructions to the chauffeur.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This time I think he’ll just pretend to throw, so
as to make us show our hand,” was what he said.
“Then when he believes he sees our intentions he’ll
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_286' id='Page_286'>286</a></span>
let it go. So first make out to stop; but when you
feel me grip your arm a <em>second</em> time, speed up for all
you’re worth. Understand all that, do you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The man said he did. Monsieur Le Grande too,
openly declared he believed Frank had solved the intentions
of the man above, basing his opinion on what
he himself would have done under similar conditions.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There they come!” announced the watchful Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pudge grunted, and tried to squeeze himself into
as small a compass as possible. He evidently feared
that he filled entirely too much space when deadly
missiles were flying around in every direction, and
that if anyone were injured it was bound to fall to
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Billy and M’sieu watched the approach of the hostile
aëroplane. It chased steadily after them keeping along
the road which unfortunately at this point happened
to be very straight, whereas more curves and bends
would have been to the advantage of those who were
being bombarded from the skies.</p>

<p class='c009'>All this was very thrilling, but none of the three
Aëroplane Boys fancied the strange experience. They
realized that should they care to abandon the van they
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_287' id='Page_287'>287</a></span>
would not receive any injury; for the Germans were
undoubtedly only trying to destroy the seaplane.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nevertheless even Pudge would hardly have voted
to forsake the <em>Sea Eagle</em> at this stage of the game.
They had a certain affection for the big air traveler;
and besides, their duty to the Company demanded that
they stick to their task, which was to get the plane
back into its hangar safe and sound, if such a thing
were at all possible.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the Taube came rapidly upon them they watched
eagerly to see what would happen. Again the man
who did the throwing of the bombs was seen to partly
raise his arm, showing that he had another of those
explosives ready for hurling.</p>

<p class='c009'>Just at the critical second, as it seemed, Frank gave
the chauffeur the signal to stop short. He already
saw that the man above had made a swift motion with
his upraised arm. It was very familiar as a trick to
the American boys; how often had they seen the first
baseman of the opposing team make the same feint
when all the while he was holding the ball concealed,
hoping to catch the runner off his base.</p>

<p class='c009'>When however he saw the bomb-thrower make a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_288' id='Page_288'>288</a></span>
duplicate movement he knew that this time it was
coming.</p>

<p class='c009'>So the second grip on the chauffeur’s arm told him
to instantly start forward again at full speed. So
sudden was the change made that the van gave a
furious spurt such as would have possibly thrown the
boys out only that they had prepared themselves
against it.</p>

<p class='c009'>For the third time Frank had hoodwinked the Germans
in the Taube. This bomb also fell back of them
quite as much as fifty feet. It struck on one side of
the roadbed, but might have done more or less injury
to the machinery of the big van, and compelled a
stop that must have spelled new trouble for the boys,
caused to abandon their charge because of the recklessness
of staying further.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! I hope that exhausts all their ammunition,”
was the prayer poor Pudge was heard to utter, when
this last stunning report announced that once more
they had escaped by a close shave from a terrible
fate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t hug that fond delusion to your heart,
Pudge,” Billy told him, jeeringly; “they’d be more
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_289' id='Page_289'>289</a></span>
apt to start out with fifty such bombs along than just
three or four. I’m hoping we’ll come up on some
marching regiment of British going to the front,
or even a field battery that could make the old Taube
climb up half a mile or so in the air. We wouldn’t
need to worry then, because they never could hit such a
tiny mark away down here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank was thinking somewhat on similar lines.
So long as there was nothing to prevent the Germans
from making those swift swoops down toward them
the peril must continue to hang heavy over their devoted
heads.</p>

<p class='c009'>He realized that it was always possible for the
aviators to come so close to them that there would
not be one chance in ten of a miss being made. Perhaps
after all it might be fear of the gun which Billy
was making out to wave that would save them in the
end. Frank had on more than one occasion in the past
known even smaller things than that to accomplish
important feats.</p>

<p class='c009'>If the danger continued he was inclined to exercise
his authority and compel his chums to dismount so as
to fall behind. In that way they would be out of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_290' id='Page_290'>290</a></span>
danger zone, while he stayed aboard with the chauffeur
to try and baffle the plans of the enemy above.</p>

<p class='c009'>And now once more the peril hovered over them.
How Billy yearned to have a gun in his hands, and
with what joy would he have started using it, in the
hope of at least causing the Germans to climb to safer
heights?</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank had altered his plan of campaign again. He
intended to keep them guessing as long as possible.
This time he arranged with the chauffeur to start
the car speeding, and then at the second signal to
suddenly apply the brake and bring it to a standstill.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the man above saw them starting off wildly
he evidently judged that was meant to be their game,
and so he sent the small but terrible bomb through
space.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank knew when it left his hand, and at that same
second he gripped the chauffeur, so that the car was
instantly brought under control. The bomb struck
ahead of them, alongside the road, and tore another
hole in the ground.</p>

<p class='c009'>Billy gave a shout as though in that way he might
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_291' id='Page_291'>291</a></span>
get rid of some of the pent-up emotion that was well
nigh choking him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never touched us!” he called out exultantly. “Better
go back home and take a few more lessons. American
boys are too swift for you fellows!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t crow too soon, Billy,” advised Frank, who
although naturally relieved for the moment, knew
only too well that this new check would be apt to
urge the determined Taube men to further exertions.</p>

<p class='c009'>He himself was casting an anxious look along the
road ahead, for Frank knew full well that their best
chance for escaping the net that was being laid for
their feet lay in the coming of friends who carried
arms that must make the aviators give the hunt over
as wasted time.</p>

<p class='c009'>As before the birdmen made a circuit. They undoubtedly
intended coming back again to try once
more to drop a missile on the elusive van, and accomplish
the mission on which they had been sent out.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank hardly knew what system of tactics to employ
this time. He had tried them all, and would
have to repeat. The best part of it was that the man
above could not read his mind, and therefore would
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_292' id='Page_292'>292</a></span>
not be able to gauge his scheme in time to reap any
benefit from it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then again it was likely that occasionally one of
the bombs might be badly aimed, and fall over in the
adjoining field. Frank was far from ready to give
up. He would keep everlastingly at it, as long as
the van driver could get his machine to obey his will,
and there was a solitary chance for them to escape
the destructive effects of those numerous explosions.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This time I’ll call in your ear what I want you to
do,” was what Frank told the pilot at the wheel. “But
no matter whether it’s stop short, or rush ahead, do it
as quick as a flash. Be ready now, for they’re almost
up to the throwing point.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As the birdmen were going the same way as the van
it was necessary that they get almost overhead before
undertaking to make a throw. The missile would
then be given a forward movement calculated to cause
it to reach a certain point aimed at.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank had practiced this same thing himself many
a time, first from a moving railway train, and latterly
from a swiftly driven aëroplane. Thus he was in a
position to know something about it.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_293' id='Page_293'>293</a></span>
Billy continued to make the best use he could of
his mock gun. He labored under the fond delusion
that he was thus doing his part in keeping the fliers
at a respectable distance, which amounted to something
after all.</p>

<p class='c009'>As for Pudge, he could only lie there on his face
unable to look up—it was so terrible to see that man-made
bird in the air above them, just for all the world
like a hawk he had watched hovering over the water
ere making a swift descent and plucking a fish out
of the lake with its talons.</p>

<p class='c009'>While he lay there on his stomach waiting in dread
Pudge felt the car give several erratic movements.
He could not at first decide whether it was stopping
or making a sudden dash, but he did hear the crash
announcing the next explosion.</p>

<p class='c009'>Realizing that he was still in the land of the living,
and as far as he could tell unharmed, Pudge raised
his head and twisted his fat neck around.</p>

<p class='c009'>He saw the Taube machine speeding on ahead; the
van was apparently unharmed by the last shot, for it
too continued along its way with a merry chug-chug-chug
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_294' id='Page_294'>294</a></span>
that sounded as sweet as any music he had ever
heard in the ear of Pudge Perkins.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What happened, Frank?” he asked eagerly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A number of things,” he was told; “first we dodged
him, and coaxed a throw. Then in his haste he made
a bad shot and wasted another of his precious bombs,
for it only tore a wound in the pasture land back there
a bit.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That makes four times he’s whacked away at us,
don’t you know, Frank!” exclaimed Pudge, as though
he considered each separate escape little short of a
miracle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s the last time in the bargain,” announced Billy,
“because there comes a troop of mounted soldiers
around the bend over yonder, and you’ll hear the
crack of guns if you listen a bit. There! what did I
tell you? See how they start right away to try and
get the Germans in the Taube. The Britishers know
that make of aëroplane as far as they can see it. A
Taube and a German are one and the same thing with
them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whee! I warrant you the lead is singing around
their ears like a swarm of angry wasps right now,”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_295' id='Page_295'>295</a></span>
ventured Pudge, now condescending to actually sit up
again, for it began to appear that their peril was a
thing of the past.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I don’t really know that I want to see those
daring fellows come down in a rush,” admitted Frank,
whose sportsmanlike spirit could find much to admire
in a foeman, as well as in a friend.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They’re ascending in spirals now,” remarked Billy,
“and edging away at the same time. Guess they’ve
had all they wanted of the game, and for the time
we’re safe from interference. Go it you terriers, or
English bulldogs, rather; keep them up so high that
they’ll see the folly of trying to hit so small an object
as our van here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Acting on Frank’s suggestion the chauffeur had
come to a dead halt with his machine. If they kept
on and lost the support of the soldiers on the road the
crafty birdmen might again chase after them, to renew
the unequal contest by hovering above and bombarding
them with those dangerous missiles until one
finally struck.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently, having mounted to a height where they
need not fear the bullets from the guns of the British
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_296' id='Page_296'>296</a></span>
soldiers the airmen once more circled around and a
bomb was dropped.</p>

<p class='c009'>It exploded not fifty feet away from where the
loaded van stood. There was somewhat of a scattering
on the part of the soldiers. No one looked
anything but annoyed because of this happening; but
this sprang wholly from the fact that they could do so
little against the aërial enemy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Just then, however, Billy cried out that “as sure as
two and two make four” he had discovered help in the
offing. Some floating objects in the air increased
rapidly in size, and quickly took on the attributes of
other aëroplanes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! more Taubes coming!” shrieked Pudge as he
glimpsed the several dots that were heading their way.</p>

<p class='c009'>M’sieu therefore proceeded to enlighten them as to
the last difference between the machines used almost
universally by the Allies and those which the Germans
believed answered their demands best of all.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They are the Allies!” he told Frank, with ill concealed
satisfaction; and after that even Pudge could
sit contentedly and watch how quickly the Germans
started full tilt toward their own lines.</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_297' id='Page_297'>297</a></span>
The two fresh arrivals pursued the other craft in
hot haste, and there could be heard faint reports from
up aloft as though they were trying to wing the fugitive
Taube. When last seen pursuers and pursued
were still making fast time toward the north.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of course Frank begged the chauffeur to put on all
possible speed so as to get as near Dunkirk as he could
before any further trouble might arise to endanger the
safety of the precious seaplane.</p>

<p class='c009'>Whether the audacious air-pilots in the Taube really
escaped or were brought down by their swift pursuers
the aëroplane boys never knew. They felt it quite
satisfactory to know that apparently their route to
the French town on the water was again free from
waylaying trouble. Besides, Frank was of the opinion
that they had left the bad part of their journey behind
them. He was assured of this fact by M’sieu, the
French pilot who had been in their company through
the whole of this adventurous day.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_298' id='Page_298'>298</a></span>
  <h2 id='chXXVI' class='c010'>CHAPTER XXVI.<br /> <br />HEADED TOWARD HOME.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Once they struck better roads their progress
was much faster. Indeed, it was not long after the
close of that short February day when they managed
to arrive at Dunkirk. The boys did not rest
until every part of the seaplane had once more been
stored in the hangar, which they found just as they
had left it, a cordon of soldiers still guarding it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Tired after that most exciting day, the boys prepared
supper. Frank asked M’sieu to join them, but
the French aviator explained that he had his report
to make out, so that the Government might complete
the bargain on the next day.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall never forget you, my brave boys,” he assured
them in parting. “I have seen many experienced
pilots handle their craft, but on my honor
I assure you never before have I found one so young
display such rare ability. After once seeing that you
were the master of your airship never once did I fear
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_299' id='Page_299'>299</a></span>
for my life, or feel that it would better things if I
took the wheel. I wish you every luck in the world;
and it is with deep regret that I say <em>au revoir</em>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just to think,” remarked Pudge, as later on they
sat around and partook of the supper that had been
prepared, “all that’s happened since we left here this
A. M.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s been a red-letter day in our experience, for a
fact,” admitted Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A glorious try-out,” said Billy, “and the <em>Sea Eagle</em>
sure behaved herself in a way to make us proud of
our Company. Only for that unfortunate puncture
in the gas tank, we’d have come through without
a single hitch.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And even that turned out to be not so serious a
thing, after all,” said Frank, “though I admit it gave
us a little concern at the time. But it had its compensations,
after all, one of which was our meeting
with that fine chap, Captain Marsden.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” said Pudge proudly, “and I’m glad to announce
that my knees are not so badly scraped as I
thought they were. I think I deserve a whole lot of
praise for making that long creep so well. It wasn’t
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_300' id='Page_300'>300</a></span>
much to you fellows, but a different proposition to
one of my shape.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll give you all the credit going, Pudge,” said
Billy magnanimously. “But, Frank, we ought to
get the plane rigged up again the first thing in the
morning, oughtn’t we?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not thinking of another flight over the battlefields,
are you?” asked the fat chum, looking concerned
again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, we’re through taking all those risks,” Frank
told him. “But you’re right about that, Billy. They
may want us to deliver the plane over to them tomorrow,
and it ought to be in apple-pie condition. I
hope to close the contract, and then we can go back
home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Leaving the one sample machine,” demanded Billy,
“and allowing the French Government to manufacture
a certain number of others, paying our company
a royalty on every seaplane built along the lines of
our patents?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That about covers the case,” Frank agreed. “Of
course, once we receive our pay, and hand the seaplane
over, we have no further interest in what
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_301' id='Page_301'>301</a></span>
happens to it, although I’d hate to learn it had met with
an accident.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You think, then, do you, Frank, that the German
spies will keep on trying to steal or destroy the <em>Sea
Eagle</em>?” asked Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If they get the chance they certainly will,” the
other replied. “They know now that all the wonderful
things they heard about it are true, and that a
fleet of aircraft built on those same lines would make
back-numbers of their Zeppelins and Taubes. But, as
I said before, let the French Government do the
worrying after the deal is closed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But if this machine were blown to smithereens,
Frank, our Company would stand to lose those royalties?”
Pudge suggested.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All of which is true enough, Pudge,” Frank told
him, “but that’s something we can’t remedy, so we’ll
have to trust to sheer luck.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They passed a quiet night, and morning found them
busily engaged in getting the dismantled seaplane together
again. The injuries which it had suffered in
making that descent, thanks to Frank’s skillful piloting,
had not proven serious, and so by the time noon
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_302' id='Page_302'>302</a></span>
came they were ready to have it looked over by the
aviators who might be sent to the hangar by the officials
of the Government.</p>

<p class='c009'>The glowing report handed in by M. Le Grande
must have hurried matters up considerably, for a little
later on several gentlemen made their appearance.
They looked over the big seaplane carefully, and then
had Frank and his chums sign several papers, one of
which was a contract on royalty covering fifty machines
which the Government might wish to construct
within a year’s time.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Frank was given a certified check from the
Government, and the transaction was considered
closed.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys took away the small bundles they had already
packed, and both hangar and seaplane became
from that hour the property of the French Government.</p>

<p class='c009'>Going to a hotel, Frank and his chums made all
arrangements looking to crossing over to London on
the next day. From there they expected to go to
Liverpool, and take passage on the first steamer sailing
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_303' id='Page_303'>303</a></span>
for New York, regardless of the danger from German
submarines lurking in the Irish Sea.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the time they left the hangar the British soldiers
were marching away, their place being taken
by French officers, who were perhaps secret service
men, or detectives. It looked as though every possible
precaution were being taken to safeguard the
wonderful seaplane of which so much was expected.</p>

<p class='c009'>As they had planned, the three boys got away on
the following day, and reached London in safety.
No sign was seen of any hostile undersea vessel during
the short trip across to English shores.</p>

<p class='c009'>In London they found that they would have several
days on their hands before they could sail from Liverpool,
so they concluded to spend the interval watching
the sights in the great British metropolis in war times,
so different from the old life known to all travelers.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was on the second morning after arriving there
that Billy, who had gone down to get a paper, while
his chums were finishing dressing, came bursting into
their room again with his face white, and a printed
sheet held in his trembling hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What ails you?” demanded Pudge, in a shivery
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_304' id='Page_304'>304</a></span>
way. “I hope now Germany hasn’t declared war on
the poor old United States over night?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Frank, they got her after all!” gasped Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you mean the <em>Sea Eagle</em>?” cried the other in
dismay.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” continued the excited Billy, “here’s an account
of how in the middle of the night a sudden
shock was felt in Dunkirk. People thought it must
be those Taubes back again bombarding the town,
and lots of them hurried down into their cyclone cellars.
But it was found that an aëroplane hangar just
outside the place had been blown to pieces with a
bomb that had either been placed underneath or
dropped from some airship.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All gone?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Blown to pieces, and they tell that it is feared several
French guards lost their lives in the bargain.
They don’t say much about it, except that the hangar
contained a new seaplane the Government had just
purchased from an American firm owning the patents,
and that as it was utterly destroyed, the loss
would be complete.”</p>

<p class='c009'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_305' id='Page_305'>305</a></span>
“Whew!” cried Pudge. “Say, I’m glad it was out
of our hands when this happened.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“For a good many reasons, too,” added Frank.
“We might have gone up with the hangar and the
<em>Sea Eagle</em> if we’d been there.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, sir, I don’t believe it would have happened
as long as Frank Chester was on deck,” said Billy
stoutly. “But, Frank, they’ll have to fight this war
through now without the help of fifty <em>Sea Eagles</em>,
won’t they?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just what must happen,” replied Frank, “because
Dr. Perkins will never consent to pursuing the matter
any further. He would not dream of supplying
patterns to the Allies after this. I’m sorry, and yet
at the same time I must say I feel a bit glad.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, let me tell you,” said Pudge, “it’s a good
thing for the Germans.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” Frank went on to say reflectively, “and it
will make us feel that after all we hadn’t any business
to help one side more than the other. But it
would have been mighty interesting reading for us
later on to learn what great stunts M’sieu Le Grande
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_306' id='Page_306'>306</a></span>
and forty-nine of his valiant French comrades were
accomplishing with the wonderful seaplanes that out-classed
anything the Germans could match against
them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, anyhow,” said Pudge, “after this war is
over I can see a rushing business for the <em>Sea Eagle
Company, Limited</em>, in France, Germany and the
United Kingdom.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Unless before that happens we’ve disposed of our
patents to the United States Government,” remarked
Frank. “This would be the most patriotic thing to
do. But even if some of our plans failed to come to
a fruitful end, we’ve certainly had the time of our
lives over on this side of the sea, and the sights we’ve
seen will never be forgotten.”</p>

<p class='c009'>While Frank and his two chums linger in London,
waiting for the announcement of the sailing day of
the steamer that is to take them home, we will have
to say good-by, and leave them there. Such venturesome
lads are certain to undertake still further enterprises
as time passes, and we can only hope that
it may be our pleasant duty to chronicle these
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_307' id='Page_307'>307</a></span>
happenings for the benefit of the boy readers who have
faithfully followed them through scenes of danger
and stress in the past, as recorded in previous volumes
in this Series.</p>

Or, Leagued With Insurgents</p>

<p class='c018'>The launching of this Twentieth Century series marks the inauguration
of a new era in boys’ books—the “wonders of modern science” epoch.
Frank and Harry Chester, the BOY AVIATORS, are the heroes of this
exciting, red-blooded tale of adventure by air and land in the turbulent
Central American republic. The two brothers with their $10,000 prize
aeroplane, the GOLDEN EAGLE, rescue a chum from death in the clutches of
the Nicaraguans, discover a lost treasure valley of the ancient Toltec
race, and in so doing almost lose their own lives in the Abyss of the
White Serpents, and have many other exciting experiences, including
being blown far out to sea in their air-skimmer in a tropical storm. It
would be unfair to divulge the part that wireless plays in rescuing them
from their predicament. In a brand new field of fiction for boys the
Chester brothers and their aeroplane seem destined to fill a top-notch
place. These books are technically correct, wholesomely thrilling and
geared up to third speed.</p>

<p class='c018'>In this live-wire narrative of peril and adventure, laid in the
Everglades of Florida, the spunky Chester Boys and their interesting
chums, including Ben Stubbs, the maroon, encounter exciting experiences
on Uncle Sam’s service in a novel field. One must read this vivid,
enthralling story of incident, hardship and pluck to get an idea of the
almost limitless possibilities of the two greatest inventions of modern
times—the aeroplane and wireless telegraphy. While gripping and holding
the reader’s breathless attention from the opening words to the finish,
this swift-moving story is at the same time instructive and uplifting.
As those readers who have already made friends with Frank and Harry
Chester and their “bunch” know, there are few difficulties, no matter
how insurmountable they may seem at first blush, that these up-to-date
gritty youths cannot overcome with flying colors. A clean-cut, real
boys’ book of high voltage.</p>

<p class='c017'><b>The Boy Aviators in Africa</b><br/>
Or, An Aerial Ivory Trail</p>

<p class='c018'>In this absorbing book we meet, on a Continent made famous by the
American explorer Stanley, and ex-President Roosevelt, our old friends,
the Chester Boys and their stalwart chums. In Africa—the Dark
Continent—the author follows in exciting detail his young heroes, their
voyage in the first aeroplane to fly above the mysterious forests and
unexplored ranges of the mystic land. In this book, too, for the first
time, we entertain Luther Barr, the old New York millionaire, who proved
later such an implacable enemy of the boys. The story of his defeated
schemes, of the astonishing things the boys discovered in the Mountains
of the Moon, of the pathetic fate of George Desmond, the emulator of
Stanley, the adventure of the Flying Men and the discovery of the
Arabian Ivory cache,—this is not the place to speak. It would be
spoiling the zest of an exciting tale to reveal the outcome of all these
episodes here. It may be said, however, without “giving away” any of the
thrilling chapters of this narrative, that Captain Wilbur Lawton, the
author, is in it in his best vein, and from his personal experiences in
Africa has been able to supply a striking background for the adventures
of his young heroes. As one newspaper says of this book: “Here is
adventure in good measure, pressed down and running over.”</p>

<p class='c017'><b>The Boy Aviators’ Treasure Quest</b><br/>
Or, The Golden Galleon</p>

<p class='c018'>Everybody is a boy once more when it comes to the question of hidden
treasure. In this book, Captain Lawton has set forth a hunt for gold
that is concealed neither under the sea nor beneath the earth, but is
well hidden for all that. A garrulous old sailor, who holds the key to
the mystery of the Golden Galleon, plays a large part in the development
of the plot of this fascinating narrative of treasure hunting in the
region of the Gulf Stream and the Sagasso Sea. An aeroplane fitted with
efficient pontoons—enabling her to skim the water successfully—has
long been a dream of aviators. The Chester Boys seem to have solved the
problem. The Sagasso, that strange drifting ocean within an ocean,
holding ships of a dozen nations and a score of ages, in its relentless
grip, has been the subject of many books of adventure and mystery, but
in none has the secret of the ever shifting mass of treacherous currents
been penetrated as it has in the BOY AVIATORS’ TREASURE QUEST. Luther
Barr, whom it seemed the boys had shaken off, is still on their trail,
in this absorbing book and with a dirigible balloon, essays to beat them
out in their search for the Golden Galleon. Every boy, every man—and
woman and girl—who has ever felt the stirring summons of adventure in
their souls, had better get hold of this book. Once obtained, it will be
read and re-read till it falls to rags.</p>

<p class='c017'><b>The Boy Aviators in Record Flight</b><br/>
Or, The Rival Aeroplane</p>

<p class='c018'>The Chester Boys in new field of endeavor—an attempt to capture a
newspaper prize for a trans-continental flight. By the time these lines
are read, exactly such an offer will have been spread broadcast by one
of the foremost newspapers of the country. In the Golden Eagle, the
boys, accompanied by a trail-blazing party in an automobile, make the
dash. But they are not alone in their aspirations. Their rivals for the
rich prize at stake try in every way that they can to circumvent the
lads and gain the valuable trophy and monetary award. In this they stop
short at nothing, and it takes all the wits and resources of the Boy
Aviators to defeat their devices. Among the adventures encountered in
their cross-country flight, the boys fall in with a band of rollicking
cow-boys—who momentarily threaten serious trouble—are attacked by
Indians, strike the most remarkable town of the desert—the “dry” town
of “Gow Wells,” encounter a sandstorm which blows them into strange
lands far to the south of their course, and meet with several amusing
mishaps beside. A thoroughly readable book. The sort to take out behind
the barn on the sunny side of the haystack, and, with a pocketful of
juicy apples and your heels kicking the air, pass happy hours with
Captain Lawton’s young heroes.</p>

<p class='c017'><b>The Boy Aviators Polar Dash</b><br/>
Or, Facing Death in the Antarctic</p>

<p class='c018'>If you were to hear that two boys, accompanying a South Polar expedition
in charge of the aeronautic department, were to penetrate the Antarctic
regions—hitherto only attained by a few daring explorers—you would feel
interested, wouldn’t you? Well, in Captain Lawton’s latest book,
concerning his Boy Aviators, you can not only read absorbing adventure
in the regions south of the eightieth parallel, but absorb much useful
information as well. Captain Lawton introduces—besides the original
characters of the heroes—a new creation in the person of Professor
Simeon Sandburr, a patient seeker for polar insects. The professor’s
adventures in his quest are the cause of much merriment, and lead once
or twice to serious predicaments. In a volume so packed with incident
and peril from cover to cover—relieved with laughable mishaps to the
professor—it is difficult to single out any one feature; still, a recent
reader of it wrote the publishers an enthusiastic letter the other day,
saying: “The episodes above the Great Barrier are thrilling, the attack
of the condors in Patagonia made me hold my breath, the—but what’s the
use? The Polar Dash, to my mind, is an even more entrancing book than
Captain Lawton’s previous efforts, and that’s saying a good deal. The
aviation features and their technical correctness are by no means the
least attractive features of this up-to-date creditable volume.”</p>
